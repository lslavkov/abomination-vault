They share certain similarities with the much more powerful shoggoths, leading to theories that the two creatures share an origin; less charitable scholars have suggested that the gibbering mouther is instead a mortal's attempt to create something akin to a shoggoth-though the question of why remains unanswered. Still others believe gibbering mouthers were sent to the world by the gods as a punishment for some forgotten but surely terrible transgression. Gibbering mouthers themselves have little to say on the matter-at least, not in any sort of sense. Scholars have wasted countless hours in attempts to make sense of gibbering mouthers' noises-studies that put researchers into danger and give results that are contradictory and confusing at best.</p>\n<p>Whatever their origin, gibbering mouthers range the entirety of Golarion. Sightings have been recorded in dungeons below ancient cities and ruins as well as many regions of the deeper Darklands layers of Sekamina and Orv.

Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.</p>\n<p>Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p>\n<p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p>\n<p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.</p>\n<p>Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells.

Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally-certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.</p>\n<p>When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their \"final trick,\" reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts.

Fusing the body of a drow with that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp-the only fleshwarp known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.</p>\n<p>Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city's periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.</p>\n<p>Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic.

Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners.

It has two massive tusks, which it uses to gore prey and tangle with rival slurks. With the slurk's natural ability to climb walls and cling effortlessly to ceilings, it can be easy for unwary cave explorers to end up on the wrong end of the beast's formidable ivory tusks.</p>\n<p>Slurks exude two very different types of foul-smelling secretions from their pale white skin. Large pustules on the slurk's back drip a sticky resin-like slime that quickly hardens upon exposure to air. By flexing its skin, the slurk can burst these pustules in the direction of intruders, covering its foes in sticky goo and severely limiting their ability to withstand the monster's other attacks, including the effects of its other secretion. Glands along the slurk's ventral side excrete an incredibly slippery and fetid grease, which protects the slurk from the immobilizing effects of its own back slime but also has the added benefit of making it extremely difficult to grapple and capture. The best way to discover if a slurk is in the vicinity is to look for hard clumps of such grease, which accumulate and dry in cave corners and amid rock piles where the slurk rests between meals.</p>\n<p>Slurks are thought to be descendants of a failed dwarven attempt to domesticate and breed large subterranean frogs as food and labor animals. Despite this apparent failure, slurks are often befriended by others who live underground. The sticky frog-beasts have proven extremely desirable to kobolds, who now domesticate and train slurks as powerful mounts and guardians. While other creatures, particularly boggards, sometimes train slurks to serve as guardians, kobolds remain those who use these creatures the most. A kobold mounted on a slurk will often hide in the upper ledges of a cave, using the advantages of height and surprise to harry foes with ranged attacks.

If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.</p>\n<p>In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC - 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

The erinyes' origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a fallen angel and one of Hell's most powerful demigods.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest.

While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.</p>\n<p>Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city's periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.</p>\n<p>Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"traits":{"value":["aberration","air"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["aklo","common"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["magic"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.377+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":-5},"dex":{"mod":6},"con":{"mod":0},"int":{"mod":2},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":10,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":1,"img":"worlds/abomination-vault/pdftofoundry/abomination-vaults2/will-o-wisp.token.webp","name":"Will-o'-Wisp","width":1,"displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"2rAKighB6Ywhk5s3","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["electricity","magical"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.377+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"jtguda2tjozvfz78bzs3":{"damage":"2d8+4","damageType":"electricity"}},"bonus":{"value":17},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Shock","sort":100000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"51r9xhJpaBdZxkK3","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.377+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Darkvision","sort":200000,"type":"action","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"wChn2PEw9GYziq2n","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>@Template[type:emanation|distance:20]{20

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"traits":{"value":["aberration","air"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["aklo","common"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["magic"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.377+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":-5},"dex":{"mod":6},"con":{"mod":0},"int":{"mod":2},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":10,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":1,"img":"worlds/abomination-vault/tokenizer/npc-images/will_o_wisp.Token.webp?1641150823708","name":"Will-o'-Wisp","width":1,"displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"2rAKighB6Ywhk5s3","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["electricity","magical"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.377+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"jtguda2tjozvfz78bzs3":{"damage":"2d8+4","damageType":"electricity"}},"bonus":{"value":17},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Shock","sort":100000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"51r9xhJpaBdZxkK3","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.377+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Darkvision","sort":200000,"type":"action","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"wChn2PEw9GYziq2n","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>@Template[type:emanation|distance:20]{20

According to the introduction, the author's original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty Death could use to fight against her influence, but as one reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the opposite effect has been achieved—by compiling these stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that made it easier for Nhimbaloth to influence the world. Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don't know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth's cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from The Whispering Reeds for too long are often cursed to rise as ghosts after death— though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<p>If a character understands the dangers of this book, however, moderated use can stall or even prevent such a fate from befalling them. If a character takes special care, they can even potentially use The Whispering Reeds for its original purpose—as a weapon against the cult of Nhimbaloth. Using the text too often or leveraging some of its more powerful effects, however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these cases, the user is exposed to the tome's curse, Empty Death.</p>\n<p>The anonymous compiler wanted to produce an enormous print run of The Whispering Reeds, but after the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies already created. This crusade caught the attention of Nhimbaloth's cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler. Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are believed to still exist. The book's sinister nature causes all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of gibberish, nonsense text.</p>\n<p>The Whispering Reeds provides several abilities, but you can't activate any of them while you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} unless you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (Investigate)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain a +2 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge about Nhimbaloth, her faith, or creatures associated with her (such as incorporeal undead, vampiric mists, wisps, and other incorporeal creatures associated with death).

Eerie mists and indistinct whispers rise in a 20-foot emanation around you, and clusters of seven perfectly spaced divots manifest in the ground, vegetation, and flesh of creatures in the emanation other than yourself and up to three creatures you designate at the time of activation. Creatures afflicted with these divots suffer from agonizing mental anguish in the form of crippling despair and take 4d6 mental damage (<span data-pf2-check=\"will\" data-pf2-dc=\"27\" data-pf2-traits=\"artifact,divination,occult\" data-pf2-label=\"The Whispering Reeds DC\" data-pf2-show-dc=\"gm\">basic Will</span> save). The mists, whispers, and strange divots fade away at the end of the round, but any creature that takes mental damage from the effect also takes a –1 penalty to saving throws against effects with the emotion trait for 1 minute.

Every 7 days that pass after you become a ghost, you must succeed at a DC 2 flat check— failure indicates that you are consumed by Nhimbaloth.

Folklore holds that, much like for the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk's physiology lends any credence to this claim.</p>\n<p>A basilisk prefers to eat petrified flesh. Once a victim has been turned to stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow and inefficient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as if in mid-petrification itself. This has even led to the saying \"as slow as a well-fed basilisk.\" Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has much need for speed.</p>\n<p>An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300 pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to a guttural gurgle when they're agitated. Though they are normally solitary creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these unusual congregations of basilisk activity is unknown.</p>\n<p>For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk's blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"traits":{"value":["beast"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:48.445+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":-1},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":-3},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":8,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":1,"img":"worlds/abomination-vault/tokenizer/npc-images/basilisk.Token.webp?1641591258173","name":"Basilisk","width":1,"displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"L4dKqPtdmyspmZtd","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:48.445+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"ouvlhsbcjxh9nhp23h22":{"damage":"2d8+4","damageType":"piercing"}},"bonus":{"value":15},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":100000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"jtwDiHkuq5uF9ND1","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:48.445+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Darkvision","sort":200000,"type":"action","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"Nl15bkRTLq869IPi","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>@Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.v61oEQaDdcRpaZ9X]{Aura}</p>\n<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 30 feet that the basilisk can see starts its turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The target must attempt a <span data-pf2-check=\"fortitude\" data-pf2-dc=\"20\" data-pf2-traits=\"arcane,aura,transmutation,visual\" data-pf2-label=\"Petrifying Glance DC\" data-pf2-show-dc=\"gm\">Fortitude</span> save.

This flexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from fish and boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct-drakes are primitive draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of their larger cousins but little (if any) of the cunning. While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties-small social groups fittingly called \"rampages\"-makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.</p>\n<p>Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"traits":{"value":["amphibious","dragon","water"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["paralyzed","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"exceptions":"","type":"acid","value":10}],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:48.464+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":3},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":-1},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":-1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":1,"img":"worlds/abomination-vault/tokenizer/npc-images/freznelkesh.Token.webp?1645135360749","name":"Freznelkesh","width":1,"displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"lg0ZOYopXDTR0Atj","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:48.464+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"mj76ftfh6ymtw57kly1p":{"damage":"2d8+3","damageType":"piercing"}},"bonus":{"value":12},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Fangs","sort":100000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"NHmjLWLocmpqvoi9","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["reach-10"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:48.464+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"blrpxgl5svywd47o3bao":{"damage":"2d6+3","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"bonus":{"value":12},"attackEffects":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":200000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"euOdAepBMeMJS2u2","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:48.464+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Darkvision","sort":300000,"type":"action","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"jJoE0z64ffbDeBmS","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Scent]</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"scent","schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:48.464+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.rqfnQ5VHT5hxm25r"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Scent (Imprecise) 30 feet","sort":400000,"type":"action","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"jbjsVEFvVsslwVHa","data":{"description":{"value":"<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within reach of the river drake's tail uses an action to Strike or attempt a skill check.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The river drake attempts to Strike the triggering creature with its tail.

Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally-certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.</p>\n<p>When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their \"final trick,\" reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"traits":{"value":["fey"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","elven","gnomish","sylvan"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"label":"Cold Iron","type":"coldiron","value":"3"}],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.362+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":-2},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":1},"int":{"mod":2},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":4,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":0.5,"img":"worlds/abomination-vault/tokenizer/npc-images/tangletop.Token.webp?1645135725226","name":"Tangletop","width":0.5,"displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Ys2OTavkoyvMU7QG","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.362+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"ability":{"value":"cha"},"spelldc":{"value":9,"dc":17,"mod":0,"item":0},"tradition":{"value":"primal"},"prepared":{"value":"innate","flexible":false},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":false},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot1":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot2":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot3":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":4}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Primal Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"4dJ4DHIq0hvHbkYj","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see.

Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally-certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.</p>\n<p>When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their \"final trick,\" reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"traits":{"value":["fey"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","elven","gnomish","sylvan"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[{"label":"Cold Iron","type":"coldiron","value":"3"}],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.362+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":-2},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":1},"int":{"mod":2},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":4,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":9,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":0.5,"img":"worlds/abomination-vault/tokenizer/npc-images/tangletop.Token.webp?1645135725226","name":"Tangletop","width":0.5,"displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Ys2OTavkoyvMU7QG","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.719,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-02-17T23:00:52.362+01:00","version":{"schema":0.716,"foundry":"9.249","system":"3.4.3.10468"}}},"ability":{"value":"cha"},"spelldc":{"value":9,"dc":17,"mod":0,"item":0},"tradition":{"value":"primal"},"prepared":{"value":"innate","flexible":false},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":false},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot1":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot2":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot3":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":4}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Primal Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"4dJ4DHIq0hvHbkYj","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see.
