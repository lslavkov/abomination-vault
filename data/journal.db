A bright light shines down into the center of each chamber. A catwalk 10 feet above the ground circles around the edge of the room without handrail or banister; at the western side, each stops at a staircase leading down.</p></blockquote><p>Belcorra kept dangerous creatures in this room prior to teleporting them via <i>Gauntlight</i>’s beam. Each cell is 10 feet square, 20 feet tall, and made of transparent stone. Each creature stands motionless in its own column, held in suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creatures haven’t aged and ignore any effect from the normal timestream as long as they stay imprisoned within their stasis chambers.  However, such effects can work on the pillars, which are made of transparent, magically enhanced stone (Hardness 18, HP 76).Ten pillars are occupied. Nine contain living creatures: a chuul (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 64), a drider (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 159), three ghonhatines (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary 2</i> 119), a gibbering mouther (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 176), a gibtanius (page 81), and two gugs (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 198). One contains a dead gogiteth because of a flaw in its </p><p>chamber’s magic. If a hero breaks the pillar around one of the creatures, roll a DC 3 flat check; on a success, the collapsing stasis effect messily kills it. On a failure, the creature returns to normal time and attacks anything in sight until destroyed. (High-level monsters, such as the ghonhatines, pose a serious danger even for 7th-level characters!)Of the five empty stasis chambers, two are noteworthy. The northwest chamber appears badly blackened, as though from soot on the inside. After the error with the gogiteth, Belcorra appointed a hag to oversee this room, knowing that her magical expertise would prove invaluable in maintaining the stasis chambers, but she didn’t intend the hag to do this job in life. Belcorra trapped the hag in this pillar, burned her to death, and bound her spirit as a witchfire. A creature entering a square adjacent to this blackened pillar receives a brief telepathic flash of Belcorra burning the hag alive and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the witchfire’s spells and abilities for 1 minute. A creature adjacent to that pillar can also just make out the objects inside it (see Treasure below). The pillar must be smashed open to retrieve them.</p><p>The second unusual stasis chamber, in the southwest, looks like the other empty chambers. However, its top and floor are both illusions. An open area below the chamber’s “floor” leads to a 5-foot-wide crawl space to the open trapdoor in area <b>D21</b>. The wisp in area <b>D21</b> comes and goes this way while invisible.</p><p><b>Creature:</b> The witchfire still guards this room. Three rounds after anyone enters, she materializes and attacks.

MUDLICKER THRONE ROOM (SEVERE 1)","content":"<blockquote><p>Splintered framing in the ceiling and floor hint that thin wooden walls once divided this stone building’s interior. With those walls demolished, only a single, large chamber remains. Rubble, swamp vegetation, and mud pile in heaps like foul nests, while a larger stack of rubble, sticks, and bones looks almost, but not quite, like a throne. A flattened mound of sand with a few dozen bits of wood and stone stuck into it covers the floor before the throne.</p></blockquote><p>The mitflits chose these old barracks for their commander, Boss Skrawng, to use as a throne hall. Boss Skrawng’s fragile throne requires constant upkeep, a task two mitflits perform when they aren’t sleeping in the filthy nests here.</p><p>Any hero looking at the sand before the throne can attempt a DC 10 Society check to realize it represents a crude map of Otari. On a critical success, the hero notes several arrows that indicate plans of attack from the direction of Fogfen.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> Boss Skrawng is always here, splitting his time between berating other Mudlickers within earshot, playing with his pet giant solifugid Bite Bite, sleeping on his throne, or planning attacks on Otari in his sand pile. If Boss Skrawng knows about the heroes in the vicinity, he sits on his throne at attention with Bite Bite at his side, ready to address them.</p><p>Boss Skrawng knew that it was just a matter of time before heroes from Otari challenged him in his domain, but he seems surprised that it happened before he actually did anything to the town. Unlike the other mitflits, Boss Skrawng speaks Common, and he imperiously demands to know why the heroes have come to bother him <i>before</i>he attacked Otari. If he realizes the heroes didn’t come to confront him, he pathetically backpedals, insisting that he has no plans to attack and that he’s harmless and friendly. He punctuates this reversal by using his trident to scatter the map of Otari at his feet. Canny heroes who can Lie to Boss Skrawng about their reasons for being here can talk to him and perhaps find out some of what he knows about Gauntlight Keep (page 12), but it doesn’t take long before Boss Skrawng’s negligible bravery and greater impatience prompt him to begin his assault on Otari by attacking the heroes.</p><p>If combat breaks out, Boss Skrawng orders his minions into melee, but he hangs back to use his blowgun from the cover of his throne. At the end of each of Boss Skrawng’s turns, the throne shakes and shudders dangerously. It doesn’t collapse unless a hero strikes it (the throne has AC 10, Hardness 2, and 3 HP). If the throne collapses, Boss Skrawng becomes flustered. He immediately falls prone and must spend at least 1 action during each of his next 3 turns sputtering and cursing in Undercommon. Boss Skrawng gives up and begs for mercy if he’s reduced to 5 or fewer Hit Points, but his followers fight to the death to demonstrate their devotion to Boss Skrawng while he lives.</p><blockquote>@Actor[Tprw9EwBM1aoo6KE]{Bite Bite - CREATURE 1}<br />Giant solifugid (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary 2</i> 246)<br /><b>Initiative</b> Perception +7</blockquote><blockquote>@Actor[Ung3q8yKLf1DmhCs]{Mitflits (2) - CREATURE -1}<br /><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 192<br /><b>Initiative</b> Perception +4</blockquote>@Actor[oUogUrunha7xDIGE]{Boss Skrawng - Creature 1}<p><b>What Boss Skrawng Knows:</b> If the heroes can get Boss Skrawng to talk, he can provide useful information.

He also knows about the “bogeys” in the keep, warning the heroes about the haunts in area <b>A7</b> and the glowing “ghosts” in area <b>A15</b>. He never visited the outbuilding on the island to the northwest, but mentions that a boat full of people came to visit it a week ago. They went into the swamp dragon’s cave while the dragon was out, but the dragon returned soon thereafter; Boss Skrawng assumes the people got eaten.</p><p>If asked about <i>Gauntlight</i>’s eerie glow, Boss Skrawng’s eyes get big, and he shakes his head, warning the heroes that the light is the creepiest haunting of them all. He confirms that every night, the light glows, and he worries that there might be a big ghost up there.</p><p>Boss Skrawng also confirms that the Mudlickers used to live in a dungeon level beneath Gauntlight Keep, but that a bunch of “mushroom-eyed people” (morlocks, although the mitflits don’t know them by that name) chased them up here many nights ago. </p><p>Boss Skrawng can provide a crude map of the first level and a partial map of the second if the heroes can successfully Request or Coerce the favor from him and supply him with the means to do so. A bribe of at least 20 gp automatically gets Boss Skrawng feeling helpful enough to provide these maps. His map of the first level omits areas <b>A12</b> to <b>A13</b>, areas <b>A19</b> to <b>A23</b>, area <b>A25</b>, and all of the secret doors. His map of the second level appears much less complete and only shows the areas once dwelt in by the Mudlickers: areas <b>B8</b> to <b>B14</b>and areas <b>B16</b> to <b>B19</b> (although he warns the heroes that a swamp dragon lives in the cave at area <b>B19</b>).</p><p><b>Side Quest:</b> Boss Skrawng hates the “mushroom-eyed people” and promises the heroes a big pile of shiny gems if they go downstairs, kill them all, and defeat their king. He describes the king as a “magic priest mushroom-eyed guy who can hurt your brain just by looking at you.” Boss Skrawng doesn’t actually have any shiny gems, and if the heroes do his quest and return with proof, he realizes that the heroes are tougher than the morlocks and that he made a terrible mistake in promising them treasure he doesn’t have. He instead throws himself at their mercy and agrees to abandon his plots against Otari forever.</p>","folder":"WxMVP4Uqw1xSAWBb","sort":1500000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"MTI6MzI2OjMxNQ"}}}

As a result, everyone who grows up in Otari has a healthy mix of fear, respect, and curiosity for the old ruins out in Fogfen and the strange lighthouse that stands at the swamp’s heart. As they grow older, townsfolk learn what’s more often accepted as truth: that the heroic founders of Otari had slain the wicked sorcerer Belcorra many years ago. For a time, thrill-seekers explored the ruins around the lighthouse called <em style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Gauntlight</em>, but today, common knowledge holds that the place has become a haven for pests—no longer a source of active danger or significant treasure after being completely picked over. Nearly 500 years has passed since Belcorra’s defeat after all, and in that time, she has only posed a menace to Otari through sinister rhymes.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">Or so the citizens of Otari believe.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">While many old legends about Belcorra are true (she did practice cannibalism, for example, but didn’t limit her diet to foolish children), the belief that she’s no longer a danger is false. Two years ago, on the 500th anniversary of the most significant event of her life—her family’s exile from Absalom for abhorrent rites—Belcorra’s spiteful ghost awoke deep beneath Gauntlight Keep. The lighthouse and surrounding ruins presented only the highest level of a vast complex Belcorra had stocked with malicious and malignant creatures: her Abomination Vaults. Belcorra’s spite has festered in the intervening centuries, and she hungers for revenge, not only against Absalom for destroying her family, but also the town of Otari and its founders—the heroes who killed her. Belcorra bides her time while she rebuilds, reenergizing the dread <em>Gauntlight</em> and reasserting her dominance over the feral and forgotten monsters of the Abomination Vaults!</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">Getting Started</h3>\n<p>The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path focuses primarily on the sprawling dungeon complex, and this adventure assumes play begins as the heroes approach the aboveground ruins for the first time. Their mutual friend, Wrin Sivinxi, has already briefed them about her sighting of a strange glow atop the ruin’s towering lighthouse. From Otari, no one other than Wrin can make out this glow, but if the heroes look up at night from the immediate environs, they can confirm what Wrin’s supernaturally acute eyes picked out from town—the top of the lighthouse does indeed glow a faint, eerie blue after dark.</p>\n<p>Of course, you don’t have to start this campaign on the literal front porch of the dungeon—if you wish, you can ease the heroes by roleplaying their initial encounter with Wrin (perhaps as she gives them an astrology reading), or after the heroes spend time in town involving some last-minute shopping or a trip to a tavern. In this case, consult the Otari gazetteer on page 64 or Wrin’s entry on page 90, but the fun doesn’t truly begin until the heroes head up the Gaunt Trail to the foreboding ruins in Fogfen!</p>\n<h3>Gauntlight Ruins Features</h3>\n<p>As the heroes approach the ruins of Gauntlight Keep for the first time, read or paraphrase the following.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sound of frogs and mosquitos mixes with water sloshing against muddy shores, all muffled by the ever‑present mists that linger in the aptly named Fogfen. As the mists clear, a shadow looms from the cloying swamp vapors—a sprawling ruin of stone and wood squats atop an island in the soggy marsh. The upper floors have largely collapsed, leaving only the stone walls of the ground floor intact. Above these ruins towers an out‑of‑place monument—a colossal lighthouse whose painted walls and iron‑cased crown have resisted the corrosive effects of the surrounding swamp.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the overgrown trail leads right to area A1, the heroes can access the ruins through other entrances. Along the southern side, waters surrounding the ruins are relatively shallow, but on other sides, the depth ranges from 10 to 15 feet, requiring a boat or swimming to navigate.</p>\n<p>With the exception of Gauntlight (area A25), the upper levels of Gauntlight Keep collapsed long ago, even falling to the ground floor in places. Areas denoted as rubble on the map of Gauntlight Keep are open to the sky above and considered difficult terrain. Where the roof hasn’t caved in, ceilings are 10 feet high unless otherwise noted. The only illumination comes from whatever sunlight filters in through the constant fog. The doors on this level are all cracked and rotten except where indicated; handling them with any amount of force causes them to split or simply fall off their hinges with a wet splintering sound.</p>\n<p>Gauntlight is magically protected from damage, as described on page 77. This protection has bled into the surrounding ruins somewhat, slowing the usual rate of decay over the past 500 years. Nevertheless, time is inexorable, and the rest of the ruins have suffered in the passage of centuries.</p>\n<p>The main faction active in the ruins is what’s left of a small gang of mitflit gremlins who call themselves the Mudlickers. Led by a large, bearded gremlin named Boss Skrawng, the Mudlickers believe they once dwelt in “glory” underground. However, the arrival of the much larger and meaner Ghost Queen morlocks forced them out of their homes, and they’ve struggled to regain their footing even since. Boss Skrawng has thus far formed the inkling of a plan to raise an army of giant insects to take over Otari. He has already exuberantly guaranteed the restoration of Mudlicker glory through this scheme, so the gang loyally follows Boss Skrawng, working hard to keep intruders—like the heroes—out of “their” ruins.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, you should take note of what the players have their characters generally do as they explore.

If given the chance to talk, Iyagian freely explains their role and offers some of their nonsense meditations.

A hero without the key from area <b>A20</b> can Force Open the door with a successful DC 20 Athletics check or Pick the Lock with three successful DC 20 Thievery checks. </p><blockquote><p>Seven square alcoves, each containing strange magical apparatuses or alchemical sets of tools, ring this damp stone chamber. The alcove to the north contains a large glass tank filled with liquid. A goblin’s corpse, clad in outdated servant’s clothing, floats inside it. A semicircular worktable covered with tools, moldy papers, and a large open book stands in front of the tank. </p></blockquote><p>Volluk Azrinae once used this chamber as his personal workshop. The worktable in front of the tank holds the bulk of Volluk’s notes. A hero Investigating these notes who succeeds at a successful DC 12 Arcana or Occultism check to Recall Knowledge learns that the workshop is devoted to both construct construction and necromancy. A critical success on this check also reveals the workshop’s emphasis is transferring mortal souls, including into a construct or a swarm of vermin.</p><p>The goblin in the tank is the preserved corpse of Borbo, once Volluk’s devoted servant. Borbo volunteered his body and soul for a technique that Volluk promised would grant immortality, though being turned into the soulbound doll named Mister Beak was not exactly the immortality that Borbo had in mind. Still, Borbo, as Mister Beak, has thus far remained loyal to Volluk. The corpse is well preserved in the tank; even if removed, it takes months to decay.</p><p>A search of the other alcoves reveals little of interest, with two exceptions: a secret door in the southwestern alcove and an incomplete soulbound doll in the northwestern alcove.</p><p><b>Secret Door:</b> The southwestern alcove contains a secret door leading down to area <b>C10</b>and from there back up to area <b>B32</b><b>. A</b> hero who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check while Searching this alcove identifies a toolbox bolted to the wall. When the toolbox is opened and the tools within it pulled, the attached secret door opens. </p><p><b>Incomplete Doll:</b> The northwest alcove contains a soulbound doll resembling an armless, legless goblin. It has an indentation in its back the same size as Mister Beak’s soul focus gem (see area <b>A23</b>). Inserting this gem activates the soulbound doll, allowing it to speak but not attack, move, or cast spells until its construction is complete. A hero might be able to complete it with enough work and expense, but Borbo remains erratic and violent.</p><p>If Borbo is “returned” to this body, he wakens quickly and begins to sob, lamenting in Goblin that his master betrayed him. He remains inconsolable until a hero can either calm him with a successful DC 16 Diplomacy check to Make an Impression or scare him with a DC 16 Intimidate check to Coerce him, or until someone places him in a position where he can see his former body in the north alcove. In any of these cases, Borbo finally goes silent and the heroes can speak to him in Common, Elven, or Goblin. Borbo has little useful to say and is prone to fits of self-pity and vitriol toward Volluk, but if the heroes ask the right questions they can get four key pieces of information from him.</p><li>The location of the secret door in this room.</li><li>The existence of a secret treasure stash behind a loose brick in the wall in his old room (area <b>B4</b>).</li><li>Master Volluk was a “powerful mastermind drow occultist artist craftsman” who had a relationship with a “book lady down below” and who worked for “Mistress Belcorra, who is very frightening and absolutely none of my business.”</li><li>Master Volluk is vain as well as cruel. If the heroes present a nice image of Volluk (such as a painting) to him and then threaten to destroy it, Volluk will lose his composure and likely make a tactical error the heroes can capitalize upon. Unfortunately, the only painting of Volluk Borbo knows about is the one in area <b>A22</b>, and it’s destroyed. In fact, only one image of Volluk remains in the Abomination Vaults today, in area <b>C36</b>.Once the heroes have learned all of his information, Borbo pitifully asks to be released. If the heroes smash the soul focus gem, Borbo’s soul is freed. For this act of compassion, Pharasma grants the hero who destroyed the gem a favor in the form of a momentary, prophetic glimpse of their fate. This allows that hero to gain a +2 status bonus to a single check, which they can apply even after they determine the check’s result. The hero has 1 month to use this boon.</li>","folder":"DSAozRwZoYs5X1AW","sort":800000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"MjM6Mjk1OjMwMw"}}}

GRAULGUST’S THRONE ROOM (SEVERE 2)","content":"<blockquote><p>A sofa‑like throne made of an old mattress, several pieces of reconstructed furniture, and dozens of bones sprawls along the northern side of this room. A narrow rivulet of muddy water trickles from a narrow tunnel to the south and forms a puddle in the room’s center.</p></blockquote><p><b>Creatures:</b> Graulgust, the self-styled king of the Ghost Queen morlocks, has chosen the majordomo’s old bedroom as his throne room. He’s rebuilt the older furniture in this area into an immense throne of sorts, and he’s attended at all times by a morlock servant tasked with sharpening Graulgust’s fingernails and toenails, rubbing his feet, feeding him worms, or whatever else Graulgust demands. Now and then, Graulgust leaves his throne room to patrol the Ghost Queen’s domain and to check up on the Ghost Queen’s shrine (area <b>B14</b>), but the first time the heroes visit the dungeon, they encounter him here. Graulgust fancies himself something of a worldly diplomat, but since he speaks only Aklo and Undercommon, communication with the heroes may be difficult. If he can’t establish communication, Graulgust grows annoyed and sends his morlock servant to fight the heroes. Graulgust steps into the fight only once his servant is slain or if he’s attacked directly. If he is reduced to 30 Hit Points, he spends an action to howl for his pet grothlut in area <b>B13</b>. If the slithering monster still lives, it comes to its master’s aid as soon as it can through the tunnel to the southwest.</p><p>Any morlocks present when Graulgust is slain gain the fleeing condition for 1 round and are frightened 3.</p><p><b>Side Quest:</b> If he can communicate with the heroes, Graulgust congratulates them for their bravery in seeking him out, and gives them a choice—they can become sacrifices for the Ghost Queen (in which case he directs his morlock servant to kill them), or they can prove their worth to the Ghost Queen by slaying the “water monster” that dwells nearby in area <b>B19</b> and bringing back her head. If the heroes agree, Graulgust allows them to leave the room only via the tunnel to area <b>B18</b>, and if they don’t have the river drake’s head with them as proof of their deed the next time they encounter Graulgust, he attacks the heroes at once for their failure. If the heroes return with the river drake’s head, Graulgust is delighted that the morlocks now have an easy way out of the dungeon to go foraging. He rewards the heroes by giving them the title of “lackeys of the Ghost Queen” and leads them on a stroll through Ghost Queen territory (through areas <b>B10</b>, <b>B9</b>, <b>B8</b>, <b>B14</b>, <b>B21</b>, and <b>B22</b>). Once he and the heroes reach <b>B22</b>, he offers them a new choice—surrender their gear and become true slaves of the Ghost Queen (and be imprisoned in area <b>B24</b>), or begin a crusade for him against the Cult of the Canker—a group of “heretic ghouls” who must be slaughtered for the glory of the Ghost Queen. If the heroes agree to this, Graulgust sends them downstairs through area <b>B16</b>with a command to not return until all of the ghouls are slain. If the heroes do so, Graulgust realizes they’re too powerful to simply dispose of; he names them “missionaries of the Ghost Queen” and commands them to leave the morlock areas and never return.</p><p>During this time, the heroes can speak to Graulgust and learn a bit more about the Abomination Vaults. The morlocks haven’t explored the northern part of this level, but he can inform the heroes of the secret door to area <b>B15</b> and provide a scribbled map of level three (including areas <b>C1</b>, <b>C6</b>, <b>C10</b>, <b>C11</b>, <b>C15</b>, and <b>C33</b>). If asked about deeper levels, Graulgust grows silent, saying “You are of the surface and do not deserve to know of our homeland.” At your discretion, if the heroes use mind control or other coercive methods, they might force Graulgust to divulge more information about deeper levels of the Abomination Vaults, but note that the morlocks left them a while ago and much has changed since Belcorra’s return.</p><p>Graulgust never speaks the Ghost Queen’s name aloud, and if the heroes speak the name “Belcorra” in his presence, he shrieks in anger and warns the heroes never to say her name again. If they do so, he attacks.</p><p>Once the heroes have secured Graulgust’s trust, the morlock occultist is shocked if they suddenly turn against him. If the heroes attack Graulgust at any point after he believes they’re working for him, he is slowed 1 for 2 rounds as he grapples with the fact that he no longer commands obedience.</p><blockquote>@Actor[usPhLQ9xq3XaycpV]{Graulgust - CREATURE 4}<br />Male morlock cultist (page 85)<br /><b>Initiative</b> Perception +11</blockquote><blockquote>@Actor[VsIUJR7L6wgOrO4u]{Morlock - CREATURE 2}<br /><i>Pathfinder Bestiary 2</i> 174<b>Initiative</b> Perception +7</blockquote>","folder":"DSAozRwZoYs5X1AW","sort":1800000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"Mjc6Njg6MjY3"}}}

Originally a collection of librarians, caretakers, and scribes, this loyal staff stubbornly kept working after Belcorra died, focusing their research on finding a way to restore their leader to life. When food stores ran low, rather than risk alerting the Roseguard by making potentially public forays to the surface, the researchers turned to cannibalism. There were plenty of other servants to eat, after all, in the conveniently nearby servants’ quarters. The onset of ghoul fever tore quickly through their ranks, but the researchers were so obsessed that they barely noticed. The scholars’ research now has a distinctly ghoulish bent: they work to gather enough “cankerous flesh” to fuel Belcorra’s full resurrection.

{"name":"D10. UREVIAN’S DOMAIN (SEVERE 7)","content":"<p>The huge doors to this room are magically sealed and emblazoned with an enormous, glowing pentagram, The pentagram’s center has a circular indentation about the size of a human hand with five deeper indentations. The heroes can discern that some device, like an amulet, fits into the indentation. </p><p>Urevian’s pendant opens the door, but it’s currently split into five fragments held by his lieutenants. A devil who casts <i>dimension door</i> while touching even a single fragment to the door can teleport to the other side. To open the door, other creatures must reassemble all five fragments and touch the pendant to the indentation. After doing so, the door effectively  stays open for good; Urevian can enact a year-long ritual to recreate the door and the pendant, but he likely won’t do so.</p><p>Urevian doesn’t realize it, but a clever user can open the door with only four pendant fragments by touching them to the door and succeeding at a DC 25 Religion check to mimic the unholy energies of the missing fragment. A creature who fails this check takes 4d12 fire damage and is stupefied 1 for 1 hour (8d12 fire damage and stupefied 3 for 1 hour on a critical failure). The five pieces are in areas <b>C5</b>, <b>D4</b>, <b>D5</b>, <b>D7</b>, and <b>D18</b>. </p><blockquote><p>A large chamber of natural stone runs north to south with an enormous stone double door as its only exit. Lit braziers cast strange shadows on the walls and bathe the room in a sinister light. Bookshelves and a sturdy desk, accompanied by neatly rolled-up scrolls and stacks of parchment, fill an alcove to the north.</p></blockquote><p>Urevian made this room his home, sealed off from the rest of the dungeon so that he can work in peace. He fashioned the door for himself, but he had to manufacture a magical pendant for Belcorra so she could bypass it. Shortly before Belcorra’s death, Urevian had the imp Szek steal the pendant back. Urevian broke it into five pieces, giving one to each of his lieutenants. His trusted devils can come and go as they please, but even they know not to bother Urevian barring official business.</p><p>The desk contains reports, inventories, and maps that depict the surface world, <i>Gauntlight</i>, and the surrounding Darklands. Of particular note to the heroes are complete maps of the fifth, sixth, and seventh levels of the Abomination Vaults, including all secret doors on those levels. The characters can also find copies of several infernal contracts, the originals of which are safely stored in Hell’s vaults. A character who Investigates the desk and succeeds at a DC 23 Society or Legal Lore check realizes that Urevian has kept tabs on Vol Rajani’s line for generations and that Carman Rajani appears to be Vol’s only surviving descendant.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> The phistophilus Urevian spends most of his time revising attack plans based on numerous contingencies. He keeps two barbazu bodyguards nearby at all times to intercept reports from his lieutenants and to keep him from being disturbed. When the heroes open the doors, the barbazus spring forward, but Urevian stops them and warmly greets the heroes. Read or paraphrase the following.</p><blockquote><p>As a ruggedly handsome devil steps forward, the long rolls of parchment hanging from his horns curl up, then unroll again. “Friends, friends! Weapons away. Truly, I am happy to see you.” The devil turns to the two bearded devil bodyguards, their glaives raised. “Stand down, you two. I doubt they are arrogant enough to fight us.</p><p>“I am Urevian, phistophilus and contracted agent of Belcorra, but I assure you I am no enemy of yours. You seek to vanquish her? Put an end to her murderous spirit, the threat she poses to mortal life, et cetera, et cetera? Then perhaps we can broker a deal—one that greatly benefits both of us with a minimal number of precious lives lost.”</p></blockquote><p>If the heroes already encountered Szek and made an agreement with her—which Urevian doesn’t really mind—he adds, “You already struck a bargain with Szek, so I know it is not a matter of if, but of what price. Trust me when I say, I am offering you an excellent deal.” For this conversation, refer to the following list of likely questions and Urevian’s responses.</p><p><b>Who are you?</b> “I am Urevian, a contract devil of some renown, if I do say so myself.”</p><p><b>What do you want from us?</b> “Simply put, you are the third-party agents I need to get out of this dreadful place and return home. You see, there is something I want but am not allowed to go and get myself, nor can I employ any infernal agents to retrieve it. No, the hands of a mortal foe of Belcorra must deliver me my prize. My devils are valueless in this regard, as are my fleshwarp soldiers.”</p><p><b>Why does it have to be a mortal foe of Belcorra?</b>“That is the delight of legalistic contract interpretation. It cannot be me, any of my minions, or any ally of Belcorra. The contract was written with the intent that Belcorra alone could give me the prize as my payment. Which, of course, she will not until I have given her the full measure of service the contract requires. However, a very technical reading means any of her foes can also provide it—and you have thus far conclusively demonstrated that you oppose her.”</p><p><b>What is it that you want?</b> “I require the soul of Carman Rajani. In his living body, if possible, though I can make do should he... perish.”</p><p><b>What do you want with Carman’s soul?</b> “I owe the soul of a Rajani to someone much more powerful than myself. It would be... unwise for me to leave the Material Plane without it. Carman is the last descendant of Vol Rajani.”</p><p><b>What will this powerful someone do with Carman’s soul?</b> “I do not know; my contract merely stipulated to turn it over. Just arranging the deal proved considerably costly,  but I stand to gain quite a bit of prestige in Hell if it is completed.”</p><p><b>What do we do if he died?</b> “I know a ritual that can summon his spirit out of the River of Souls and back to the place where he died. There it can be captured. If you sign an agreement with me, I shall teach it to you.”</p><p><b>We can’t give you someone’s soul. That’s evil!</b> “Is it? I say it is a lesser evil to turn over the soul of one corrupted individual than to allow an entire town’s destruction. Far less bloodshed on all sides. I do not want to raze Otari, and I don’t want to kill you. However, the contract I have with Belcorra requires that as long as I remain within her employ, I must pursue the domination of the surface world and the destruction of her enemies. Once my contract ends, so does my obligation to her. All I need is the soul of Carman Rajani to fulfill the contract.”</p><p><b>How’s Carman Rajani corrupted?</b> “Oh, that bastard of a man. His soul is already damned for lying, cheating, theft, vandalism, destruction of property, arson, abuse of power, blackmail—even a murder. It is quite clear where he shall go in the afterlife. You would simply cut out the bureaucracy by giving him to me directly.”</p><p><b>If we hand over Carman, he’ll never have a chance at redemption.</b> “Do you honestly believe that? Just recently he burned a library and stole a historical relic in some misguided ploy to win a political office, which he would just use to further abuse his power and increase his wealth. If I did not need his soul for this specific purpose, I would hire him.”</p><p><b>What do we get out of this arrangement?</b> “Peace for Otari. I will leave, taking all of my devils with me. And when I go, the barrier preventing you from getting to the lower level will disappear. If you would like, I can direct my fleshwarp minions to clear away the blocked staircase, giving you a second way down. I can even broker further agreements between you my devils.”</p><p><b>What further agreements?</b> Urevian can arrange for infernal contracts (page 74) with any of his surviving barbazus (<i>pact of blood-taking</i>) or erinyes (<i>right of retribution</i>). As Urevian drafts these agreements on his devils’ behalf, skill checks to interpret the contracts use a DC of 33 (Urevian’s Legal Lore DC), rather than the contracts’ item levels. </p><p><b>We’ve already defeated your devils; you have nothing to invade with.</b> “Ah, but I can conscript more after I kill you. The inconvenience is, at best, temporary.”</p><p><b>We’ll never make an agreement with you!</b> “Are you sure about that? Consider carefully. Turning down my offer most likely means your death.” Urevian gestures meaningfully to his barbazu bodyguards.</p><p>If the heroes take Urevian’s offer, he uses his Draft Contract ability to summon a contract for them to sign in blood. Urevian drafts an honest offer: upon his receipt of Carman Rajani (or his soul) from the heroes, he will leave the Material Plane along with all his devils remaining in the Abomination Vaults. His departure immediately removes the barrier in area <b>D3</b>. Before leaving, he will, if the heroes wish, order any fleshwarps to clear the staircase leading down from area <b>D1</b>. His departure otherwise doesn’t affect the fleshwarps or other creatures in the prison, leaving the heroes to deal with them. Heroes who sign are compelled to work toward delivering Carman to Urevian, as from a <i>geas</i> ritual (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 412).</p><p>If the heroes ultimately decline Urevian’s offer, he sighs in disappointment before saying, “What more should I have expected from mortals?” He then orders his barbazus to attack. He casts <i>flame strike</i> before entering melee with his diabolic quill. </p><p>Convinced the heroes are better than mere mortals in combat, the barbazus fight to the death. The more injured Urevian becomes, the more he tries to convince the heroes to accept his deal. However, Urevian breaks off combat only if the heroes agree to accept his terms. If he’s slain, the magical barrier in area <b>D3</b> vanishes, though the stairs remain blocked.</p><blockquote>@Actor[lFFfiIUeAj1eniQu]{Urevian - CREATURE 9}<br />Page 90<br /><b>Initiative</b> Perception +19</blockquote><blockquote>@Actor[WjiZy5zCEVcm8Eih]{Barbazus (2) - CREATURE 5}<br /><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 88<br /><b>Initiative</b> Perception +13<br /><b>Items</b> hellforged glaive <br /><b>Melee</b>[one-action] hellforged glaive +15 (agile, deadly 1d8, evil, forceful, magical, reach 10 feet), <b>Damage</b> 1d8+7 slashing plus 2d6 evil and infernal wound</blockquote>","folder":"F4IDB6yFgO5hQbek","sort":8100,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"NTE6Njg6MTIz"}},"_id":"ACuiX7llP1cfu6FH"}

{"name":"Carman RajaniDesperate Thief in Over His Head","content":"<p>Carman Rajani is the last living descendant of the famous Vol Rajani, member of the Roseguard and co-founder of Otari. Carman grew up on stories of Vol’s bravery, her dedication to her friends, and her skill-at-arms with her famous sword, the <i>Cooperative Blade</i>. As a boy, Carman didn’t understand why his family’s sword was hanging in the Dawnflower Library and not in their house. It was theirs, or so his parents insisted.</p><p>As Carman grew older, he first worked at Otari’s blacksmith’s shop, Blades for Glades, and later won the shop in a lucky wager against the prior owner. Yet he couldn’t forget his family’s sword. Officially, the Menhemes family claimed ownership over Vol’s ancient blade but “allowed” it to stay in the library in an act of purported generosity that Carman found offensive. </p><p>The summer his parents were waylaid and slain by bandits on the road from Absalom, Carman became a broken man. His work at the smithy became erratic, and he stopped relaxing with his friends and helping his community. With no other direction, Carman squandered his inheritance, spending the money on entertainment, fine clothes, and rare whiskey. He started spending more time gambling and drinking at the Crook’s Nook than he did at his smithy. Eventually the inheritance money ran out, and Carman was faced with a sizable debt. Several owed favors later, he started grifting travelers or hustling them at the knife-throwing board at the Crook’s Nook. But his vices still outpaced his earnings from petty cons, and soon he took to outright thievery under the tutelage of Yinyasmera, owner of the Crook’s Nook and ringleader of the Osprey Club, Otari’s thieves’ guild. The “Ace of Blades” is the moniker given to the best knife thrower in the Crook’s Nook, and Carman Rajani has held that title for so long that it’s become his nickname among fellow members of the Osprey Club.</p><p>Within a few years, Carman had settled into his new life, working as a smith during the day, carousing at the Crook’s Nook at night, and occasionally engaging in some petty larceny when his coin purse started to get light. When he heard rumors that people thought he was wasting his life, though, it stung his pride. He resolved to run for mayor against Oseph, to show the whole town that his family was the equal of the Menhemes family. </p><p>Everyone thought Carman’s candidacy was a joke. The second time he ran, his platform became nothing more than sharp personal attacks against the Menhemes family; the townspeople felt the joke had gone sour and considered it a waste of their time. He met their jibes with violence, getting into brawls to prove he was the better man. The third time he ran for office, he actually put in effort to help the community; though he lost by much smaller margin, he took the loss as proof that kindness can’t get you any further than your fists can. The fourth time, he tried to force a successful campaign with open bribes and blackmail. </p><p>Oseph won by a landslide, showing up on Election Day wearing the <i>Cooperative Blade</i> as part of his celebratory regalia. Carman finally decided that the magic sword must be the key to his success. Everyone in town knew it brought Otari good luck, so whoever held the sword had the town in their pocket. As Vol’s heir, he deserved the sword. He begged Oseph to sell the weapon, but Oseph suspected it was some new scheme—or worse, connected to one of Carman’s rumored crimes or debts—and countered with delays, excuses, and price increases. </p><p>Finally, Carman decided he’d had enough. If he wanted his family’s sword back, he’d have to take it. He just needed to find the right opportunity.</p><p>Carman is Nidalese in heritage, with pale skin, dark hair, and severe facial features. His lifetime of work at Blades for Glades has made him exceptionally muscular to supplement his natural grace, though his lifetime of hard drinking is starting to take its toll. He’s a sloppy dresser who wears once-fine, sweat-stained clothes and a belt hanging with work hammers. </p><p>Carman is a bitter, hateful man. He bases his self-worth on how he compares to Vol, his famous ancestor. Since tales about her are, by now, all embellished myth, there’s no way Carman can measure up. His many failings give him a sense of inadequacy that causes him to lash out at others, particularly when they’re expressing doubt in his capabilities or worth. Yet Carman still thinks that as the last descendant of a Roseguard hero, he’s better than everyone else in town and deserving of far more than life’s given him. </p>","folder":"F4IDB6yFgO5hQbek","sort":10900,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"ODg6MTA4OjYzMA"}},"_id":"CgK1GLuKaQ1IffAp"}

Thick patches of moist mushrooms, some nearly four feet tall, grow along the western shore of the lake, while a narrow trickle of water feeds in from a tunnel to the south. A thirty‑five‑foot‑long pavilion made of stone stands in the middle of the lake, elevated ten feet above the water level by more than a dozen stone columns. The entire pavilion is encrusted with damp, pale fungus. Two stone bridges arch from the pavilion—one connecting it to a door set in the northern wall and another to a door to the east. A faintly flickering campfire burns in the middle of the pavilion, its smoke curling to the ceiling.</p></blockquote><p>The fungus growing here may look ominous, but it is harmless. The lake has steep banks that drop away into a nearly uniform depth of 15 feet.</p><p>Belcorra built this pavilion as a place to meditate. The denizens of the Abomination Vaults don’t visit here, as the lingering presence of Otari’s ghost in area <b>D18</b> subconsciously influences them to stay away. Living creatures (such as the pavilion’s current inhabitants) don’t feel these influences.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> A grizzled, feral-looking man lives in the pavilion. He is Jaul Mezmin, a violent criminal and murderous werewolf wanted in the town of Otari for the slaying of several locals 30 years ago. Jaul’s last victim was a woman named Ayla Lathenar, wife of Keeleno Lathenar, the owner of the Otari Market. Jaul hid in plain sight as one of the druids of Stone Ring Pond while he committed his murders, but when he was found out, he escaped capture by leaping from the Otari cliffs into the sea. The tides pulled him into sea caves, leaving him nearly drowned, but over the following weeks he recovered and found his way here.</p><p>Jaul’s been living here ever since. His skin is pasty and pale, and he reeks of mushrooms and sour sweat. Cave crickets make up the bulk of his diet. His only companions over the years have been a series of loyal wolves; when one perishes, Jaul simply makes his way out through the caves to bond with another. At first, he made plans to return to Otari, but after living in this cave for so many years, Jaul knows no other life.</p><p>The heroes disrupt that life, though. When Jaul notices them, he staggers up to the edge of his pavilion and howls and barks wildly to warn them away. The wolf at his side accompanies his howls with its own. A hero who succeeds at a DC 27 Society check to Recall Knowledge realizes this man is the killer who disappeared from Otari a generation ago. At your discretion, a hero familiar with Jaul’s legacy treats the result of this check as one degree of success greater than the rolled result.</p><p>If the heroes attack Jaul or attempt to enter his pavilion, he assumes his hybrid form and attacks. If the heroes hang back, he continues to bark and howl until someone can calm him down. As soon as the heroes successfully use any skill with the linguistic trait on Jaul (such as to create a convincing Lie, use Diplomacy to Make an Impression, or try to Coerce him), he stops howling and blinks several times as he remembers that he can talk as well. A few moments later, he calls out in a halting voice, warning the heroes that this is his territory and they are not welcome. His initial attitude is hostile, and if the heroes try to talk to him too much he grows frustrated and uses his magic to attack from afar. Depending on the questions the heroes ask, Jaul may reveal his name or who he is, but it’s likely only a matter of time before the paranoid werewolf loses patience and attacks.</p><p>If Jaul is reduced to 30 or fewer Hit Points, he begs for mercy and promises to give the heroes a reward if they spare him. This reward is Ayla’s necklace. Heroes who show Jaul mercy can get him to talk further; Jaul is somewhat familiar with the eastern half of this level (areas <b>D14</b> to <b>D19</b>). For example, he can warn the heroes of the shadowy ghost on the island to the south (area <b>D18</b>) and tell them that if they enter the “nightmare stairs” to the north (area <b>D19</b>), they’d do well to keep their eyes closed if they want to ever escape them. If the heroes spare Jaul, he uses the sea caves to emerge near Otari and flees the region entirely. Whether or not he takes up his murderous ways is left for you to decide.</p>@Actor[4jxPQKZbQCVxBeAU]{Jaul Mezmin - Creature 6}@Actor[ANsUaniPKpb2XmOa]{Jaul’s Wolf - Creature 4}<p><b>Side Quest:</b> The heroes can bring Jaul in, dead or alive, to Otari for a 50 gp bounty.

{"_id":"HO01HZqiPW3PqcoA","name":"Wrin Sivinxi - Helpful Patron Haunted by Spectral Visions","content":"<p>Wrin Sivinxi grew up in the small village of Glitterbough in Kyonin, but a traveler wouldn’t find her hometown if they were to visit that nation today, for Glitterbough was destroyed 10 years ago by demons in the service of Treerazer. Despite the loss of her hometown, Wrin feels no sadness or despair about the event, for none perished in Glitterbough’s fall. In the days before the demon army’s attack, Wrin had a vision of the disaster. She warned her parents and neighbors, and their trust in her visions gave the town the time it needed to relocate everyone in the village to safety. When the demons came, they found Glitterbough deserted, and when they burned it in frustration, they suffered greatly from the magical traps the elves had left behind to greet them.</p>\n<p>When she came of age a few years later, Wrin left her parents and friends, eager to find her own place in the world. As she traveled, she trusted in her visions and her unusual faith in a pantheon of deities associated with space and time she refers to as the Cosmic Caravan, looking to the nightly stars to make decisions for tomorrow. Her knack for finding lost things and gathering strange treasures made establishing her own curio shop an obvious choice, and it wasn’t by chance that she decided to set up that shop in Otari—it was simply the port she’d arrived at when her capacity to carry her collection finally outweighed its portability.</p>\n<p>She opened her shop, Wrin’s Wonders, 4 years ago. In that time, she’s become part of the community, even if many of its citizens regard her as a good-natured eccentric. Sales of the strange and bizarre aren’t brisk in the small town, but that’s no matter to Wrin—she’s patient and has enjoyed her time in Otari so far. One day, she hopes to make enough money to fund a trip west, for she’s heard tell of an abandoned observatory in the small town of Crookcove on Ravounel’s southwestern coast that she hopes to purchase and transform into a temple devoted to the Cosmic Caravan. But for the time being, she’s content to stay in Otari and sleep under the stars.</p>\n<p>Wrin’s tiefling ancestry is impossible to miss, and it’s something she long ago decided to embrace. Eyes devoid of pupils, small ram horns curling around her elven ears, a thin tail, and fingertips that sparkle with motes of glittering lights leave no doubt that she is touched by supernatural forces. Yet her quick smile and welcoming attitude have always helped her to secure friendships during her travels.</p>\n<h3>Campaign Use</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0.5em;width:983.438px\">Wrin’s primary purpose is to motivate the heroes’ initial explorations and to give them a focal point to gather around. The <em>Abomination Vaults Player’s Guide</em> assumes that Wrin is a contact the heroes share in common, so when she notices a strange buildup of eerie light atop distant <em style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Gauntlight</em>, it’s natural for her to confide her fears in the heroes.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">As the campaign progresses, Wrin can help the heroes in other ways, such as by performing astrology readings for the heroes to aid them in their explorations. While she won’t give her store’s wares away for free, her establishment is the best place to buy and sell the odd magical treasures heroes tend to find and crave. Wrin can also introduce the heroes to the wonders of the spirit world—her tutelage unlocks the ghost hunter archetype (page 81). Despite the claustrophobia she suffers, if the heroes find themselves in over their head in the Abomination Vaults, you can have Wrin face her fears to brave the dungeon and mount a rescue. Of course, you shouldn’t use Wrin in this capacity except as a last resort to keep the campaign from reaching an untimely end!</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">@Actor[277XutpkUStTPCSE]{Wrin Sivinxi - Creature 5}</p>","folder":"rjx60NAe2H6vqR6U","sort":17000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"OTI6MTM4OjYzMQ"}}}

{"name":"UrevianContract Devil Eager to Make a Deal","content":"<p>For over 500 years, Urevian and Belcorra have had a binding contract. The agreement stipulates that Urevian must help train and lead Belcorra’s army of abominations in an attack on the communities of the Starstone Isle from <i>Gauntlight</i> all the way to Absalom (which today includes Otari). Urevian must also commit the devils that owe him allegiance to Belcorra’s cause. In exchange, Belcorra agreed that Urevian would receive the soul of the famed warrior Vol Rajani. The Rajani soul is of key interest to certain mighty velstrac demagogues, and Urevian committed the soul before he’d even acquired it. Doing so cost Urevian much of his personal power, but he considered the opportunity too great to ignore.</p><p>The arrangement was supposed to take years or even decades, but not centuries. The intent was that Belcorra would march her monsters all the way to Absalom, with Urevian acting as a force commander. As Vol Rajani was a well-known defender of the city, she was sure to meet the forces in battle, and Urevian could snatch her soul away. Urevian was convinced he could acquire the valuable soul by loophole if not by direct action. First, the contract specifies “the Rajani soul” as the payment, without specific mention of Vol Rajani; any Rajani would suffice for Urevian’s purposes. Second, although the contract prohibits Urevian or any of Belcorra’s allies from delivering the soul, to ensure that Belcorra alone would pay the devil his due, the language permits any of Belcorra’s foes to deliver the Rajani soul instead.</p><p>When Belcorra died, the contract was held in perpetual abeyance. Urevian performed the bare minimum to keep his bargain, training his devils and the fleshwarps they captured. He can’t simply leave; his arrangement with the velstrac demagogue requires him to first appear in the demagogue’s presence when he leaves the Material Plane, and Urevian knows he mustn’t show up empty-handed.</p><p>Things changed with Belcorra’s return. Now, Urevian has the possibility of finally escaping his contract. However, fulfilling his agreement to the letter would require a costly battle past Jafaki’s followers and an even more costly battle once he got to the surface. Reliable minions are, he knows, difficult to replace. Urevian prefers the quick resolution of obtaining the Rajani soul from an outside party right away.</p><p>Charm has always been Urevian’s greatest asset. While other contract devils pride themselves on airtight clauses, hidden meanings, and steep penalties to gain the upper hand, Urevian prefers to smile his way into a straightforward deal that’s beneficial to everyone. Devils have a bad reputation for taking advantage of their marks; playing against that is one of Urevian’s strengths, and he uses it to great advantage.</p>","folder":"F4IDB6yFgO5hQbek","sort":11300,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"OTI6MjA2OjYzMQ"}},"_id":"JRWaSEv5qVfhTKJC"}

Although this museum contains replicas of the Roseguard’s adventuring gear and even a few common items that the adventurers once owned, the specific icons Otari Ilvashti’s ghost described to the heroes aren’t here. Mayor Oseph Menhemes, Vandy Banderdash at the Dawnflower Library, or Wrin Sivinxi at Wrin’s Wonders can point the heroes in the right direction.</p><p>The icons are described on page 71. Aesephna Menhemes’s <i>hunter’s brooch</i> is in a locked shadowbox in the music room of Menhemes Manor. If the heroes frankly tell Oseph Menhemes why they need it, he permits them to borrow the brooch for as long as they’d like. For being honest with him, they automatically earn the Menhemes’s support (as described in the Otari Gazetteer in <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #163: Ruins of Gauntlight</i>), which allows the heroes to Earn Income by tutoring the Menhemes children and, more pertinent to this adventure, lets them meet Dorianna Menhemes and aid with her malady (page 9). If the heroes previously earned the Menhemes’s support, he lets them keep the brooch in exchange for all they’ve done for him and the town.</p><p>The bookseller Morlibint keeps Zarmavdian’s <i>Thresholds of Truth</i> in his academic collection at Odd Stories. If Odd Stories already supports the heroes, Morlibint gladly allows them to borrow the book. If not, they must promise Morlibint that they’ll take special care of the spellbook before he loans it to them. Convincing Morlibint might require extensive promises, a demonstration on the proper care of ancient tomes, or both. Either way, Morlibint wants to get a full account of what they do with it (and any related magical phenomena).</p><p>Vol Rajani’s longsword, the <i>Cooperative Blade</i>, is normally on display at the entrance to Dawnflower Library, but it was stolen the previous night.</p>","folder":"tZ9K7dim9esMGNBV","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"Nzo2ODozNTE"}}}

Its attic serves as the guildhall for Otari’s thieves’ guild, the Osprey Club—a function that’s perhaps the town’s worst-kept secret, as evidenced by the edifice’s very name.</p><p>The owner of Crook’s Nook is a lanky woman named Yinyasmera. While she’s never run for mayor, her influence in town remains as strong as that of any publicly elected official thanks to her position in the Osprey Club.

Transparent stone makes up the southern wall, which looks into a vast room filled with square, transparent pillars surrounded by a catwalk. A jumble of metal scrap lies against this transparent wall. </p></blockquote><p>While transparent from this side, the southern wall appears opaque from the other side. Strategists could look out over the stasis chamber to the south to select creatures to transport with <i>Gauntlight</i>. The metal scrap used to be a high catwalk, but the gug in area <b>D8</b> wrecked it in a fury when Urevian sent a barbazu to provide a report rather than personally meeting with her.</p><p><b>Creature</b>: An imp named Szek flutters near the ceiling, holding a small notebook and charcoal pencil. She records observations about the various prisoners with recommendations on how to use them in the upcoming invasion of Otari. Sample entries include “gibbering mouther—ground manipulation could disable or destroy bridges, such as the tavern bridge near river mouth.”</p><p>When Szek detects the heroes, she casts <i>invisibility</i>and attempts to parlay rather than fight. </p><blockquote><p>“Close the door! Close the door! I don’t want to get caught talking to you—you’ll get us all tortured. So, surface dwellers, eh? Glad to see you. You’re taking down Urevian, right? Nasty devil. Bad business keeping him around—yup, yup, yup. How about we leave each other alone and pretend we never saw each other?”</p></blockquote><p>Although perfectly happy if the heroes leave, Szek will speak to them if broached. Her starting attitude is indifferent, and she remains invisible until the heroes change her attitude to friendly, which requires a character to succeed at a DC 17 Diplomacy check to Make an Impression (as that’s Szek’s Will DC). </p><p>Szek tires of running menial errands for Urevian. She’s looking for someone more pliable to serve and hopes to enter into a <i>devil’s luck</i> infernal contract with one of the heroes. If the heroes improve her attitude, she not only offers this contract, but answers questions as best she can (whether or not they take the contract). </p><p><b>What Szek Knows:</b> Szek knows that Urevian has some sort of arrangement with Belcorra, but he wants to get out of it, even if it means making a deal to undercut Belcorra’s efforts. She suggests talking to Urevian to find out more, but she knows they’ll need the five parts of a pentagram amulet to open the door. </p><p>If asked about the pieces’ locations, she speculates that the fragments could be held by the sarglagon sent to sabotage the laboratories level (area <b>C5</b>), Azvalvigander the quartermaster (area <b>D4</b>), Barcumbuk the smith (area <b>D5</b>), Iyagian the guard (area <b>D6</b>; they don’t have one), the gate-forgers (area <b>D7</b>), or the strange Motley Man who Szek sees sometimes but who terrifies her (she refers to Ysondkhelir in area <b>D18</b>). </p><p>Szek knows that Urevian got tired of visitors from the lower levels and blocked one route with magic and the other route by simply stuffing it full of rubble. She’s certain he could open either easily. </p><p>If asked about the higher levels, Szek gleefully admits to participating in a “big fight” between Urevian and the worm-monsters a long time ago. She locked a powerful wizard in his room with just a few pitons and still takes pride in the act. The wizard—Chafkhem in area <b>B17</b>—would be keen to learn that Szek is the one who imprisoned him. </p><p>As far as the prison level’s layout, Szek has limited information. She knows only about areas <b>D1</b> through <b>D16</b>, although she’s aware of an angry green spirit in area <b>D17</b>. She has a rough idea of each room’s forces, but she doesn’t know about the traps in areas <b>D11</b> or <b>D16</b>; in fact, she believes area <b>D16</b> is haunted.</p><blockquote>@Actor[CQ0nksRTFxTjbf6Z]{Szek - CREATURE 1}<br />Female imp (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 87)<br /><b>Initiative</b> Perception +7</blockquote>","folder":"F4IDB6yFgO5hQbek","sort":8000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"NTA6MzI2OjQ1OQ"}},"_id":"PYMDaDdH4Ftbzces"}

{"_id":"RgSwQqU4ErNmDg5k","name":"Otari Ilvashti - Restless Spirit with Valuable Clues","content":"<p>Otari Ilvashti recalls little of his life. His time as a child growing up in Absalom and his adventures with the other members of the Roseguard have dwindled to distant but pleasant memories. His fear of the devastation Belcorra plans to unleash upon Absalom is what keeps him shackled to this world as a ghost.</p>\n<p>When the Roseguard fought Belcorra in Gauntlight Keep, she unleashed a powerful magical explosion that collapsed the room where the fight took place. Belcorra and three heroes avoided the collapse and fought on—to Belcorra’s ultimate defeat—but the rogue Otari was caught beneath the collapse. His companions assumed he was pulverized, but Otari had fallen into a level beneath Gauntlight Keep that none of the Roseguard knew existed. Otari desperately wanted to escape to the surface and share his discovery, but Belcorra’s minions forced him to flee ever deeper into the vaults, until finally he was cornered in a dead-end cave by an immense otyugh that left him trapped and suffering from filth fever. Otari died in that deep cave, but his ghost lingers on.</p>\n<h3>Campaign Use</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0.5em;width:983.438px\">Otari’s role is to present the tasks necessary to reach the lower levels of the Abomination Vaults described in <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #164: Hands of the Devil</em>. Once the heroes encounter Otari’s ghost and drive off the wisps that torment him, he relates his tale of woe. He has difficulty remembering much of his life, but becomes very emotional if he learns that the Roseguard survived and named their town after him.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">While Otari’s information about the dungeon is centuries out of date, his supernatural link to the Abomination Vaults affords him glimpses into the inner workings of the dungeon and its key players. As Otari speaks to the heroes, make sure he conveys the following key points of information to them, either in the form of answers to questions or volunteered information.</p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left:var(--space-m);width:983.438px\">\n<li style=\"padding-left:var(--space-s)\">Belcorra harbored a grudge against Absalom and intended to use her sinister lighthouse, <em>Gauntlight</em>, as a weapon against the city. The Roseguard never discovered its actual use, other than that it had something to do with the ability to transport creatures across significant distances and could animate the dead with its light. None of the other Roseguard members knew about the Abomination Vaults beneath <em style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Gauntlight</em>. Otari learned about them only in his last few days alive.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-left:var(--space-s)\">Some property of the Abomination Vaults increases the manifestation of ghosts, spectral undead, and haunts within their domain. Otari initially believed this was a side effect from <em>Gauntlight</em>, but has now come to suspect a link to a much more ancient and ominous source deep below this level. He knows nothing of Nhimbaloth, but if the heroes tell him of the Outer God, he suspects her influence is the source.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-left:var(--space-s)\">Belcorra herself is now a ghost, although she cannot move far from the site to which she is anchored. Otari can sense her somewhere deep underground and is also aware that the range of her movements is slowly expanding.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-left:var(--space-s)\">Otari suspects Belcorra intends to fully reactivate <em>Gauntlight</em> and use it to begin her long-delayed attack on Absalom. She must be put to rest before she can finish this task. Otari isn’t sure how to stop her, but believes that clues await discovery in the deeper levels of the Abomination Vaults.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-left:var(--space-s)\">Finally, Otari feels the barrier in area <strong>D12</strong>blocking progress deeper into the Abomination Vaults. He understands that it is powered by the souls of Belcorra’s defeated enemies. Fortunately, he also understands how to take the barrier down. The Roseguard were the adventurers who finally killed her, and their psychic resonance can drop the barrier. The heroes must find and place four icons the Roseguard once held dear onto the altar in area <strong style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">D13</strong> to do this. Otari’s thieves’ tools are here with his bones and serve as his icon. The other icons are the brooch belonging to the cleric Aesephna Menhemes (which bears the religious symbol of her god, Erastil), the spellbook belonging to the wizard Zarmavdian, and the trusty longsword of the fighter Vol Rajani.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">Once the heroes take on the burden of facing and defeating Belcorra and open the way to the deeper levels of the Abomination Vaults, Otari’s soul is free to travel to its final reward. You should ensure he has imparted all of the above information to the heroes before he fades away.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">If you wish, though, you can put a darker spin on things—rather than have Otari’s spirit achieve freedom, it could instead be captured by the temple of Nhimbaloth at the bottom of the Abomination Vaults. In this case, the heroes should learn about Otari’s fate through a vision or nightmare, or perhaps even see his tormented ghost pulled downward against his will. Otari’s ghost remains trapped until the heroes finally defeat Belcorra.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">@Actor[jwfw2jrwAe2MSj4z]{Otari Ilvashti - Creature 9}</p>","folder":"rjx60NAe2H6vqR6U","sort":16800,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"OTA6MTI2OjYzMA"}}}

He certainly won’t go with the heroes willingly if they explain what they want with him, but the heroes could trick him.

Urevian explains that the heroes must perform the <i>call spirit</i> ritual (which he can teach them) while holding a specially-prepared gemstone (that he also provides).

The smell of spilled beer and fried morsels pervades the room. In the southeast corner, an elevated stage overlooks the seating. Doors lead out of this room along all four walls, including a double door to the west that looks to be the main entrance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once an elaborate dining hall for Belcorra’s gladiators and guests, this area has, over the years, taken on the function of a tavern for fleshwarped creatures, those waiting to undergo fleshwarping, and a few rare visitors. It has had its current name—the Warped Brew Tavern—for more than a century. Due to Jafaki’s general lack of discipline, many of this level’s denizens come here to drink, gamble, argue about who’s next to go under the seugathis’ knives, and listen to Shadow Malice, the resident band.</p>\n<p>The door to the southwest opens onto a steep stairway that leads up to area <strong>B9</strong>. When the poltergeists there started flinging debris down the stairway, the patrons stopped using it, except as a garbage disposal. The stairway is greater difficult terrain.</p>\n<p><strong>Creatures:</strong> Five creatures are usually found in the tavern: a female drider named Lallizanx flipping through a book filled with crudely drawn drow erotica, two morlocks playing a card game called towers, a morlock tending the bar, and another morlock complaining to the bartender about having to wait so long for her fleshwarping. There’s a 1 in 4 chance that the tavern’s band, Shadow Malice, is on stage when the heroes arrives; instead of randomly determining this, you can also decide whether the band is playing.</p>\n<p>Lallizanx is ostensibly the bouncer but cares little about what happens in the tavern. The morlock patrons hope to be chosen for fleshwarping in the near future, and even the morlock bartender looks forward to becoming like the powerful dreshkans who come here from time to time.</p>\n<p>Everyone here assumes that intruders from the surface, like the heroes, have come to start a fight. If the heroes quickly display peaceful intentions, these patrons keep a close eye on them but resume their business. The bartender has only a few drinks available but sells them to the heroes at inflated prices.</p>\n<p>The patrons all have a starting attitude of Unfriendly to the heroes. Lallizanx casts <em>suggestion</em> on any hero who persistently bothers her, insisting that they leave her alone. The morlock bartender gives only a halfhearted attempt to prevent the heroes from leaving by either of the doors behind the bar; she doesn’t consider her pay sufficient to stand in the way of well-armed intruders. The morlock patrons all idolize the band Shadow Malice and bring them up in conversation.</p>\n<p>If a fight breaks out, the tavern’s urdefhan manager, Vischari, comes from area <strong>C16</strong> in 3 rounds to join the battle. Vischari and Lallizanx fight to the death to protect the tavern they consider their home turf, while any morlock reduced to fewer than 10 Hit Points flees. If the members of Shadow Malice are present, they retreat to area <strong>C18</strong> rather than risk injury.</p>\n<blockquote>@Actor[Yfkrm0M5AFc0pOME]{Lallizanx - CREATURE 6}<br />Female drider (<em>Pathfinder Bestiary</em> 159)<br /><strong>Initiative</strong> Perception +13</blockquote>\n<blockquote>@Actor[VsIUJR7L6wgOrO4u]{Morlocks (4) - CREATURE 2}<br /><em>Pathfinder Bestiary 2</em> 174<br /><strong>Initiative</strong> Perception +7<br /><strong>Melee</strong>[one-action] wooden chair +7 (forceful), <strong>Damage</strong>1d8+4 bludgeoning<br /><strong>Melee</strong>[one-action] jaws +9 (agile), <strong>Damage</strong> 1d4+4 piercing<br /><strong>Ranged</strong>[one-action] pewter mug +8 (range increment 10 feet), <strong>Damage</strong> 1d4+4 bludgeoning</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Side Quest:</strong> If the heroes seem curious about Shadow Malice (regardless of the band’s presence), the morlocks all start chanting the band’s name and “Challengers!” in Undercommon. It might seem like the morlocks intend to set up the heroes to fight against the band, but they call for a battle of entertainment, not of weapons. The cries bring Shadow Malice onto the stage, if the band’s not already there, and Ryta, the band’s vocalist, explains the rules.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You want to challenge us? Then let’s get to it. We’ll each face off one-on-one. Each pair squares off with some kind of show: music, acrobatic tricks, displays of strength, whatever. Then we perform as two groups—mine then yours—and let the crowd tell us who’s the best overall!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The challenge has an individual and a group phase. The individual phase pairs each hero with one of Shadow Malice’s four members (if the party has more than four heroes, some must sit out this phase). A band member provides the best solo performance they can on their instrument of choice, then the paired hero can attempt a DC 22 check with a relevant skill, such as Performance, Acrobatics, Athletics, or any you deem appropriate to impress a crowd. (This DC is the Performance DC of the band member, which is 22 for all of them). Record each hero’s degree of success.</p>\n<p>The second part is the group phase. Shadow Malice performs a high-energy musical number, then passes over their instruments (if the heroes don’t have any). Unlike the individual contests, this phase requires a Performance check. If the heroes balk, Ryta grins and says, “This stage is for <em>performers</em>, friends.” To compete, one hero must attempt a DC 22 Performance check. Any number of other heroes can Aid at this check. In addition, the hero attempting the Performance check gets a +2 bonus for each hero who got a critical success in the individual phase, a +1 bonus for each hero who got a success in the individual phase, and a –1 penalty for each hero who got a critical failure in the individual phase. Unlike the normal rules for bonuses, these bonuses are cumulative with each other.</p>\n<p>If a character succeeds at this final Performance check, Ryta acknowledges that the heroes are Shadow Malice’s superiors on the stage and resolves to leave them alone. Word gets back to Vischari about the heroes’ success, and the tavern manager treats them with a modicum of respect. On a critical success, Ryta gives the heroes the group’s instruments, insisting that the instruments belong in the hands of such talented performers. The other members of Shadow Malice grumble at this decision but sullenly comply.</p>\n<p>If the character fails at this final Performance check, Shadow Malice sees the heroes as being out of their depth and resolves to attack the heroes right on the stage. The band members’ statistics are described in area <strong>C18</strong>. Anyone remaining in the tavern simply watches the fight, considering it a bloody part of the show. On a critical failure, the patrons join the fight after the first round, which means the heroes should likely make a hasty retreat before getting overwhelmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> The gambling morlocks have a total of 15 gp, 181 sp, a gold tooth worth 5 gp, and a perfectly fossilized tuna skeleton on the table. Behind the bar, there’s 28 gp and 74 sp in the cash box and a vial with sloughing toxin (page 72) that the bartender can use to poison troublesome patrons.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Award:</strong> If the heroes participate in the challenge against Shadow Malice, award them the usual 30 XP for completing a side quest. If the heroes win, award them an additional 80 XP.</p>","folder":"WcK7E8T6AYFcxkxG","sort":1100000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"MzI6MzI2OjU5MQ"}}}

He explains that he hails from a small drow settlement deeper underground called Yldaris, but he’s unwilling to give much detail about Yldaris to strangers. He says only that the city welcomes traders and that the heroes should visit, peacefully, if they come to the area. Falxi and two other drow were scouting farther from their settlement than usual when urdefhans attacked them; he was knocked unconscious and somehow ended up here. Though selfish, Falxi isn’t evil (nor are the other inhabitants of Yldaris). If the heroes let him go, he eventually returns to Yldaris and might meet the heroes there. Yldaris features prominently in the next adventure, “Eyes of Empty Death,” and the heroes’ encounter with Falxi should suggest it’s a safe place to visit.</p><p><b>Jedzeli:</b> This unfortunate skulk (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary 2</i> 243) hangs limply on her hook, her right hand visibly missing.

{"name":"D7. SUMMONING CHAMBER (SEVERE 7)","content":"<blockquote><p>A stairway at the room’s south end leads north to a platform overlooking a cylindrical chamber. Half-melted candles cover a stone altar perched on this platform’s edge. Above the altar, water slowly drips from a crack in the ceiling and onto the platform, the droplets rapidly evaporating in the stifling heat. Six heavy chains suspend a wide metal disk above a magma pool that illuminates the chamber with an orange glow. A fiery pentagram features visibly atop the disk.</p></blockquote><p>Belcorra had geomancers divert a natural magma flow to pool here. She then commissioned the creation of the ritual altar and the summoning circle atop the disk. Belcorra summoned several fiends in this chamber, binding each to her service. The greatest of these was Urevian, as her contract with him gave her access to all the devils who serve Urevian as well. </p><p>The ceiling is 20 feet tall at the doors of this room. As the stairs descend to the platform, the ceiling stays the same height, so it’s 25 feet above the platform. The disk is at the same level as the platform, but the 15-foot gap over magma makes it daunting to reach. </p><p>The air in this chamber is magically cooled to only severe heat (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 518), dealing 1d6 fire damage every hour. The 10-foot-deep magma pool presents a greater danger; immersion in the magma deals 20d6 fire damage each round. A hero who succeeds at a DC 23 Crafting or Religion check realizes that the magma’s heat powers the summoning circle.</p><p><b>The Cracked Ceiling:</b> A character who succeeds at a DC 23 Nature check (or a related Lore skill, such as Mining Lore) recognizes that the crack in the ceiling allows water to drip down from the underground lake directly above (area <b>C4</b>). If the heroes widen this crack—a task requiring appropriate tools, the ability to reach the ceiling, and several hours of chipping away  the stone—the drips become a trickle, then a flood. The rush of water fills the room with steam and cools the magma to stone over a few hours. The hero also knows that cooling the magma deactivates the summoning circle for good and somehow permanently destroys it.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> Twin erinys sisters are trying to convert the summoning circle into a permanent gate to Hell. Urevian insisted that they not be disturbed and posted the guard outside this chamber. Concerned more with the theory of extraplanar portals than the application, the sisters spend a lot of time discussing their work but haven’t done much to enact it. Furious at interruptions to their discourse, they most likely attack. However, if they think a hero shares their interests (such as if they see a hero summon a creature in a fight), they offer to cease combat to discuss the finer points of extraplanar lore.

{"_id":"cjlj4ovzzFSLnGhY","name":"400 - OTARI GAZETTEER","content":"<p>Though the immense metropolis of Absalom has long dominated the urban scene on Starstone Isle, civilization has always thrived across the island. Otari’s beginning is relatively recent and involved a few false starts along the way. When Belcorra Haruvex arrived in the region in 4230 ar, drawn by a series of sinister visions, the coastal region was practically uninhabited. Here, she built <i>Gauntlight</i>, the keep surrounding the area, and the sprawling dungeons below the structure—without attracting notice. A group of adventurers known as the Roseguard eventually learned of Belcorra’s villainy and slew her, but at the cost of one of their own: a rogue named Otari Ilvashti.</p><p>Having lost both their friend and their taste for adventuring, the three surviving members of the Roseguard decided to retire. They spent much of their savings constructing several buildings and a sizable pier in a sheltered cove south of the site of their final battle. Since their lost friend’s fondest dream had been to settle down in a small seaside village, they named this new village after him.</p><p>For some decades, Otari prospered as a fishing village, though its population never grew beyond a hundred or so. The three surviving Roseguard adventurers lived to a ripe old age, ultimately passing away from natural causes—an accomplishment many adventurers never achieve.</p><p>With the passing of the last Roseguard, Aesephna Menhemes, in 4290 ar, Otari’s fortunes began to dwindle. Within the span of a few years, its citizens had all drifted elsewhere. Otari lay abandoned for decades before a group of kobolds called the Stonescales moved in. When the kobolds started luring in passing ships during bad weather to ambush their crews and steal their cargo, it didn’t take long for new adventurers to arrive and vanquish them. </p><p>While the adventurers moved on soon thereafter, their backer, Maklanni Menhemes, remained behind. Maklanni, Aesephna’s granddaughter, conceived a plan to revitalize Otari as a lumber town. It already contained dozens of buildings that only needed to be restored, after all, and the Osprey River remained ideal for a mill and lumberyard. However, one setback complicated Maklanni’s plan—the steep slopes and cliffs surrounding Otari made transporting timber to the ocean difficult.</p><p>Maklanni’s solution was ingenious—she constructed a wooden flume that allowed for the easy transport of lumber from the woods to her mill, and from there down an astounding loading ramp that extended from the top of the 200-foot-tall cliff to the harbor below. The mill and flume made Maklanni wealthy and revitalized Otari, although it made her an enemy of the Kortos Consortium, which had a stranglehold on the island’s lumber industry. Two other small lumber companies broke from the Kortos Consortium and settled in Otari as well, each paying for use of Maklanni’s invention. </p><p>Today, Otari is a thriving settlement—the largest on the coast between Absalom and Diobel. Maklanni is long dead, but her descendant Oseph carries on the family trade and also serves as the town’s mayor. Unsavory representatives of the Kortos Consortium have secretly infiltrated Otari and seek to undermine the town’s security. However, a far greater threat looms over the city: Belcorra has returned and is preparing to light the baleful fires of <i>Gauntlight</i> once again!</p>","folder":"XS2VWKfJm4FIsft6","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"Njc6MjA5OjY0OA"}}}

Chandriu harbored a poorly hidden adoration for Belcorra’s apprentice, Volluk, and in the days after Belcorra’s death, Chandriu tried to convince him to flee with her to start a new life together somewhere far from the Abomination Vaults. Volluk spurned Chandriu, insisting that “Belcorra needs me now in death even more than in life; you should consider the same!” Chandriu returned here in despair, only to be murdered by her disgruntled scribes eager to get out from under her bullying, and she grasped for Volluk’s portrait as she died.</p><p>As with so many others who had the misfortune to perish in the Abomination Vaults, Chandriu arose as a ghost. She now spends her days floating among the work spaces, as if looking over the shoulders of scribes to appraise their work, not realizing that any time has passed at all since the hour preceding Belcorra’s death. When the heroes enter the room, the ghost mistakes them for new scribes and chastises them for their tardiness before ordering them to begin transcribing the old books stacked here. Any attempt to do anything other than comply with Chandriu’s commands (including simply leaving the room) arouses her anger and prompts her to attack. </p><p>If the heroes each sit at a carrel and begin to work—or even pantomime working—Chandriu is satisfied unless they stop. She entertains brief questions and discussion from her “scribes,” though, and will answer any questions the heroes have, within reason, and that don’t make her realize that Belcorra is dead or that she’s a ghost. Every 10 minutes, she drifts through the secret door to area <b>C37</b>, and a hero who watches and makes a successful DC 12 Perception check notes that her actions suggest a hidden door (even though she simply passes through the wall).

Her nightmares lessen in intensity, but she feels exhausted and anxious during the day. She begins to talk with the Motley Man as an imaginary friend even when awake, eschewing activities with anyone else. Her disposition becomes erratic and childish, and she often scratches absently at her right hand. Her siblings don’t want anything to do with her, and even her parents find her hard to put up with. She’s been afflicted by Ysondkhelir’s <i>outcast’s curse</i> spell, which the heroes might detect or remove normally. If they do, Ysondkhelir casts it on her again the following night.</p><p>With a successful DC 26 Diplomacy check, the heroes gain Dorianna’s trust and get her to open up to them. If they have the support of Menhemes Manor, they have a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Only one hero can attempt this check each day (on a critical failure, they must instead wait 1d4 days). On a success, Dorianna insists that the Motley Man is real and discusses one of the following two subjects with them (on a subsequent day’s success or an initial critical success, she reveals both). </p><p><b>Gifts:</b> The Motley Man gives her gifts in the form of her old childhood toys, and the best of them is the stuffed griffon. Even a cursory examination reveals that something hard is sewn inside the stuffed toy; characters who open it up find a large, flawless ruby worth 30 gp. Even if the heroes take this ruby, the next time Dorianna dreams, it reappears inside another childhood toy from wherever it is. It’s keyed to Dorianna and doesn’t leave her for long. </p><p><b>Wrist Writing:</b> Dorianna absently points out several bruises on her right wrist that she can’t remember getting. A hero trained in Occultism who views the bruises can attempt a DC 22 Occultism check to Decipher Writing. A hero who speaks Aklo gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. On a success, the hero notes that the words are related to some dream-traveling rituals; on a critical success, the hero notes the word “Leng” among the bruises. </p><p>Either of these clues points to the involvement of a malevolent extraplanar creature called a denizen of Leng. Leng is a terrifying extraplanar location just past the Dimension of Dreams, where cruel and sinister people called denizens of Leng live. A hero who succeeds at a DC 24 Occultism realizes the nature of the creature plaguing Dorianna; if the heroes obtained both clues, then any hero trained in Occultism realizes this without a check. Though the heroes might identify the source of Dorianna’s trouble, there’s not much they can do for her yet, because Ysondkhelir doesn’t ever physically get anywhere near her.</p><p><b>XP Award:</b> Award the heroes 80 XP if they discover a denizen of Leng is involved in Dorianna’s malady.</p>","folder":"tZ9K7dim9esMGNBV","sort":1300000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"MTE6Mjk1OjEzNQ"}}}

Jafaki sends the drider to answer any knock at the door since other seugathis sometimes come by for Jafaki’s guidance. The heroes might take advantage of this habit to take the preoccupied researcher by surprise.</p><p>If the heroes try to Force Open the door open or Pick the Lock, Jafaki realizes they’re intruders and prepares for a fight. The drider scrambles up to the ceiling and Jafaki envenoms their rapier and casts <i>levitate</i> to stay out of melee reach.</p><p>Both of these foes fight to the death—the drider out of loyalty to Jafaki, and Jafaki because they can’t abandon their life’s work. </p><blockquote>@Actor[XizS7UQnQurPRTaK]{Jafaki - CREATURE 8}<br />Page 88<br /><b>Initiative</b> Perception +18</blockquote><blockquote>@Actor[IPksqii90ah7Q4OE]{Drider - CREATURE 6}<br /><i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 159<br /><b>Initiative</b> Perception +13</blockquote><p><b>Side Quest:</b> Jafaki’s current project is to manufacture a flesh golem with occult machinery here. They intend to assemble it using the morlock’s head and the neatly labeled body parts scattered around the room. A sketch pad bears the instructions for assembly and notes that ambient necromantic energy in the Abomination Vaults will animate the flesh golem. The key to this experiment is the occult machinery keeping its head alive, which focuses this ambient energy. Finishing the golem requires Jafaki’s knowledge and expertise; doing so goes beyond the heroes’ current capabilities. </p><p>The heroes can, however, disconnect the machine to end the morlock’s torment. Disconnecting this machinery requires a hero to succeed at a DC 22 Occultism check. On a success, the morlock head dies and the machinery can’t be used again. On a failure, or if the heroes simply smash the machine, the morlock head dies, but the invisible energies accumulated within the machine seek another source of stitched skin and meat to animate as a flesh golem. </p><p>If the heroes left the fleshy statue of Belcorra intact in the Temple of the Canker (area <b>C34</b> of the dungeon’s third level, described in “Ruins of Gauntlight”), these errant energies animate it as a flesh golem (<i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> 184) instead. The flesh golem comes to life with an instinctive drive to find and kill whoever ruined the machine. It always knows the distance and direction to the hero responsible and immediately begins pursuit. As the golem is far away, it might take hours to catch up to the heroes, at your discretion, but when it does, it fights until destroyed.</p><p><b>Disappearing Morlocks:</b> Jafaki is wrapped up in their experiments and projects but nevertheless has an effect on the surrounding dungeon. Every few days, Jafaki calls for one of the morlocks in the Warped Brew Tavern to come here with the promise of being fleshwarped into a dreshkan. The morlocks eagerly come since Jafaki has created the many dreshkans in the Abomination Vaults, but it’s a ruse. Jafaki instead carefully dissects the morlock to add additional living pieces to their current golem project. If the heroes come here but retreat, Jafaki continues these gruesome experiments; when the heroes return, there should be more morlock parts affixed to the machinery (and fewer morlocks in area <b>C11</b>, if any remained there). Once he has run out of morlocks to experiment on, Jafaki starts capturing and dissecting members of Shadow Malice instead. </p><p><b>Treasure:</b> Scattered around the lab are all the pieces for expanded alchemist’s tools, expanded healer’s tools, and a superb repair kit. None of the proper pieces are together, however, so it takes several minutes of hunting around to assemble them all. A <i>crafter’s eyepiece</i> and two vials of moderate antiplague sit on the shelves. </p><p><b>XP Award:</b> Award the heroes 80 XP, rather than 30 XP, for successfully disconnecting the occult machinery. If they fail, award them this amount if they defeat the flesh golem in combat.</p>","folder":"WcK7E8T6AYFcxkxG","sort":2600000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"NDI6MzI2OjY1MQ"}}}

{"_id":"nVbuCxl8k5GxDmWB","name":"002 - THE THEFT","content":"<p>While the heroes braved dangers in the Abomination Vaults’ upper levels, Carman Rajani, Otari’s blacksmith and the last living descendant of Vol Rajani, stole the <em>Cooperative Blade</em> because he feels the sword rightly belongs to him, along with the good luck locals believe it grants the town.</p>\n<p>Carman crept into the Dawnflower Library and started a small fire in the book restoration room. While the fire distracted the staff, he broke the <em>Cooperative Blade</em>’s display case and fled with the sword.</p>\n<p>After an hour, the staff had put out the fire without any serious injuries and only a few lost books—a miracle the acolytes attribute to Sarenrae’s protective embrace. By the time anyone discovered the theft, Carman was already on his way to a local cave called Smuggler’s Refuge. It didn’t take long for the town guard to realize that the missing Carman Rajani was the prime suspect. He had pestered the mayor about the sword for years, and a few witnesses saw someone matching his description absconding from the library, clutching his cloak over some long object.</p>\n<p>Vandy Banderdash, head priestess of the Dawnflower Library, meets with the heroes when they come to ask about the sword. She can barely contain her rage, although she seems more angry about the theft than the fire. She asks them to find Carman and bring him in alive to face trial and receive an appropriate punishment.</p>\n<p>Finding Carman shouldn’t be too hard, as he acted hastily and didn’t have time to cover his tracks or prepare a good cover story. The Otari Garrison can’t provide much help; Captain Longsaddle points out that since Carman isn’t in town or along the roads, the guards don’t have jurisdiction to pursue him. He harrumphs and adds, “Good riddance to that troublemaker. He’ll keep running if he knows what’s good for him.” He doesn’t provide any aid to capture Carman but happily takes him into custody if the heroes bring the smith into town.<strong>Blades for Glades:</strong> The heroes find Carman’s blacksmith shop, Blades for Glades, closed; they won’t find any clues here. If the heroes already had the support of Blades for Glades, they recall that Carman mentioned Smuggler’s Refuge in the past, so it’s a likely hideout.<strong>Combing the Town:</strong> If the heroes ask about Carman’s location in Otari, nearly everyone suggests they go to the Crook’s Nook. A hero who succeeds at a DC 20 Diplomacy check to Gather Information hears about the Smuggler’s Refuge from townsfolk and recalls that Carman spent time there in his youth (as did many people in Otari).</p>\n<p><strong>Crook’s Nook:</strong> Asking around at the Crook’s Nook brings the owner, Yinyasmera, over to talk. She brazenly asks for a 10 gp “special fee” for food and drinks; heroes who pay up (or succeed at a DC 20 Diplomacy check to Request information) get her to open up about Carman. The blacksmith has been a little too bold to remain in her good graces, and this theft is the last straw. She mentions that Carman has likely gone into hiding at Smuggler’s Refuge outside of town. If Yinyasmera has a favorable opinion of the heroes from their actions in “Ruins of Gauntlight,” she gives this information for free.</p>\n<h3>Smuggler's Refuge</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0.5em;width:983.438px\">This cave is only about an hour outside of town, just a short walk through the forest, north of an abandoned fish camp.

Today, with the recent decline in smuggling, Otari’s young people camp in the cave when they need a break from the lumber town.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:983.438px\">The map of Smuggler’s Refuge appears on page 8.</p>","folder":"tZ9K7dim9esMGNBV","sort":1900000,"permission":{"default":0,"qE1KhDrO8xa5P2lb":3},"flags":{"pdftofoundry":{"id":"ODo5OTo0OTU"}}}

The western end of the hall, where a large fireplace for cooking food once stood, now serves as an altar of sorts.

A bare spot on the room’s north wall has been decorated with mud and blood to depict the same feminine form as the statue.</p></blockquote><p>The Ghost Queen morlocks erected this shrine too honor Belcorra, but as the morlocks fear the ghost as much as they revere her, they only rarely spend time in this room.

{"name":"CHAPTER 3: Soul Keepers","content":"<p>Five centuries ago, Belcorra summoned the contract devil Urevian to administer her Abomination Vaults. Always looking to sweeten a deal, Urevian further offered to train Belcorra’s armies and lead her invasion of Absalom—for a price. Urevian knew that Vol Rajani, legendary Roseguard swordswoman and exiled royalty from Nidal, lived in Absalom. The Rajani family has, for reasons even Urevian doesn’t know, special value to certain parties in Hell. In exchange for Urevian’s aid, Belcorra guaranteed him Rajani’s soul. When the Roseguard attacked <i>Gauntlight</i>, bringing the soul right to Belcorra’s doorstep, Urevian was in Hell, committing Rajani’s soul to a much more powerful entity—even though he didn’t yet have it. By the time he returned, the Roseguard had prevailed with Belcorra slain. The sorcerer couldn’t fulfill her end of the bargain, trapping Urevian in the interminable process of preparing a surface invasion that would gain him nothing. Worse, he couldn’t return to Hell without the Rajani soul, and his agreement forbid him from capturing the soul directly or through his infernal proxies. Urevian was trapped. </p><p>Now that Belcorra has returned, Urevian’s agreement with her can be fulfilled. He plans to train her armies and invade the surface, starting with Otari; his spying has informed him that Carman Rajani, whose soul can also fulfill his contract, lives there. </p><p>Urevian has fully mobilized his devils to train the fleshwarps who’ve come into his realm. Belcorra placed several horrible monsters in stasis, though Urevian doesn’t yet know how to reliably free them and has made that discovery his next priority.</p><p>Although the devils can use <i>dimension door</i> to reach the surface quickly, Urevian’s other troops need physical access, which required him to approach the seugathi Jafaki about allowing them through the laboratories. Jafaki feared another diabolic ruse—a reasonable assumption given the seugathis’ past relations with Urevian—and agreed on one condition: Urevian must allow the seugathis  to “personally inspect” all infernal forces and make “upgrades and improvements.” Urevian knew this ploy was for Jafaki to get their tentacles on endless research subjects and that the fleshwarper would never sign off on any troops. Urevian is ready to wash his hands of this entire arrangement, but alas, he has a contract.</p><p>Urevian sees the heroes as an unexpected opportunity and a potential solution. If the heroes stay bent on clearing out the Abomination Vaults, possibly slaughtering their way through Jafaki and the seugathis, then all the better for the devil. Urevian has ordered his devils to keep an eye out for the heroes, to kill all but one or two, and then bring him the survivors for negotiations. He plans to convince the remaining heroes to deliver Carman Rajani to him. Otherwise, he’ll march his army up through the dungeon and destroy Otari.</p><p>Urevian’s devils have had little contact with the Abomination Vaults’ lower levels, even in less troubled times. He received food from the farm level below to feed his mortal soldiers but cares little for the denizens there or their machinations. Since Belcorra’s return, Urevian has seen an increase in urdefhans, drow, and other creatures parading through the prison level, and he has had enough. He recently blocked the stairs leading down to the lower level with rubble (area <b>D1</b>) and erected a magical barrier across the large elevator opening (area <b>D3</b>). Urevian knows that his control over these barriers probably gives him some leverage with the heroes, too, which further benefits him.

These resources have remained here since her demise, since the ghouls don’t know this room exists.</p><p>The largest book on the northern shelf is a large journal that focuses largely on Belcorra’s hatred of Absalom. It’s written in Aklo, and a hero who spends 8 hours reading it learns of her family history from their exile to poverty and her eventual return to the region to build a lair from which she hoped to exact revenge on the city that disgraced and impoverished her family. The last several pages of the journal document much of her work in building the Abomination Vaults. While the journal doesn’t offer many specific details, it mentions construction of fleshwarping laboratories, arenas where she pitted enemies against monstrous champions for her amusement, prisons, torture chambers, links to the Darklands, and a great temple where “once the Empty Death herself brushed against this fragile world.” Belcorra’s entries often speak of her minions in the abstract, as if bragging about how many have come to serve her in creating the complex, but she only ever mentions one by name: her “amusingly vain” apprentice, Volluk Azrinae. One of the last entries describes how this apprentice arrived from “a community of upstart and meddlesome drow below” to serve Belcorra.

{"_id":"uU85YWhF73GUNQ9b","name":"000 - CHAPTER 1: Into the Training Grounds","content":"<p>The wicked sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex constructed the Abomination Vaults almost 500 years ago. While the upper levels of her massive dungeon were primarily for her personal use, she designed the middle levels for work. Belcorra trawled the Darklands for dangerous predators and bloodthirsty aberrations, but their feral power wasn’t enough for her. She needed to mold them into an army to assault the metropolis of Absalom. In the middle levels, she had these forces forged for battle, in body and in mind. The fifth level thus included a massive arena and training grounds where gladiators would fight for the right to lead her monstrous troops.</p>\n<p>In the Darklands, Belcorra encountered wormlike aberrations called seugathis, who had a curious eagerness to serve her. She then repurposed the sixth level—formerly support rooms for her monsters and their trainers as well as a “preserve” where she kept large beasts—as laboratories. There, the seugathis sought to perfect fleshwarping to create flawless monsters under the guidance of their leader, Jafaki.</p>\n<p>Belcorra constructed the smaller seventh level as a prison. She didn’t intend to keep many captives, since creatures who displeased her could serve as raw flesh for Jafaki’s experiments or as food for her monsters. However, one of Belcorra’s chief administrators, the contract devil Urevian, insisted on building the prison. Before long, the level became a warped mirror of Hell.</p>\n<p>A decade into building her dungeon and honing her preparations, Belcorra died at the hands of the Roseguard, a group of four adventurers from Absalom. The Abomination Vaults fell into disarray almost immediately. Urevian attempted to assert control, but Jafaki’s aberrant creations fought the devil’s forces to a standstill. A sort of stalemate settled over the middle levels, and the borders of control have shifted only slightly over the centuries. Jafaki merely wanted peace to continue their experiments; Urevian idly prepared for the surface invasion as his contract required of him, even though he knew it was almost impossible for him to complete his contract because Belcorra had died.</p>\n<p>Word of the seugathis’ skilled fleshwarping spread. Before long, arrogant or desperate creatures came seeking remarkable transformations, though few ultimately considered their changes to be improvements. Fleshwarped creatures continue to commonly appear throughout the middle levels.</p>\n<p>When Belcorra returned as a ghost only a few years ago, the Abomination Vaults hummed with the power of her return. The significance of this event was lost on the research-focused Jafaki, but not on Urevian; the devil realized he could now finally fulfill his contract with the sorcerer. Yet Urevian had already spent centuries contemplating a well-drafted loophole that would allow him to simply return to Hell without providing her any aid at all. To do so, Urevian needs a specific mortal soul: that of Vol Rajani, one of the Roseguard. Vol is long dead, of course, but the clause can still apply if Urevian receives the soul of Vol’s last descendant, Carman Rajani. Urevian couldn’t collect the soul while Belcorra was merely dead, but now that she has returned, Urevian is willing to abandon his extensive preparations if someone can get Carman’s soul for him—and he selects the dungeon delvers from Otari to handle this matter on his behalf.</p>\n<h3>The Spectral Seal</h3>\n<p>At the end of the previous adventure, “Ruins of Gauntlight,” the heroes learned that Belcorra has returned and has reactivated the powers in her Abomination Vaults—particularly those of <em>Gauntlight</em>, the landlocked lighthouse atop the dungeon.

She lived here for many years as she oversaw the construction of the dungeons both above and below, but once the project was complete, she abandoned this home for one even deeper underground. She moved her belongings deep below as well, leaving these chambers abandoned and empty, but when she became a ghost, her spiritual energy reacted in much the same way Otari’s did by manifesting lingering images within these rooms where she spent so many hours.</p><p>As a result, each time the heroes step into one of these four rooms, they are greeted with a brief ghostly image of the room as it once was. Each time, they also see a vision of Belcorra herself within the room. Descriptions of each room’s visions are given below, but chances are good that the heroes won’t have time to study the scenes at first—see Creatures below.</p><p><b>D20a:</b> This room was once a comfortable sitting room with two chairs and a low end table between them.

Although the image has no sound, Belcorra is speaking animatedly about something, and Volluk is listening attentively. </p><p><b>D20b</b>: Originally a lounge with two plush divans, this room flashes an image of Belcorra relaxing while reading a large tome. A hero who succeeds at a DC 18 Perception check sees that the book is titled <i>The Whispering Reeds</i> (this book is currently in area <b>C35</b>).</p><p><b>D20c:</b> A well-set table reveals this to have once been Belcorra’s private dining room. In the image, she sits alone at the table, drinking a glass of wine and enjoying an elegantly plated roast arm that looks disturbingly human.</p><p><b>D20d:</b> Belcorra’s bedroom features a large bed along the west wall. The stone archway to the north shimmers as a portal opens and Belcorra steps through with a cruel smile on her lips and blood on her hands.</p><p><b>Creatures:</b> A powerful and horrific entity known as a voidglutton has dwelt within these chambers since Belcorra abandoned them. Unlike many of Belcorra’s minions, the voidglutton came to her of its own free will, drawn from across the dimensions by echoes of Nhimbaloth’s presence. It volunteered to aid Belcorra as a guardian of the upper shrine (area <b>D13</b>), but once she relocated her personal effects to deeper within the Abomination Vaults, it took over these rooms. It basks in the latent fears and pains of the dungeon’s haunts and ghosts.</p><p>When Belcorra rose as a ghost, the voidglutton took note and visited her, learning of her plans to reactivate <i>Gauntlight</i> and realizing it would take time to awaken the dormant artifact. The voidglutton helped her refine the plans to testing <i>Gauntlight</i>, and has recently done so with Volluk’s aid (as the heroes experienced at the beginning of Chapter 2). Since then, the voidglutton has lurked here, understanding that it’s just a matter of time before Belcorra contacts it again to enact the next stage of her plan.</p><p>The voidglutton moves from room to room in this area, as it finds the echoes of Belcorra’s spirit soothing.

{"name":"JafakiInhuman Alchemist Creating Perfect Monsters","content":"<p>Most seugathis are spawned from their neothelid masters, complete their programmed tasks, and die. Jafaki is an exception, no less cruel and calculating than other seugathis but with motivations that are, at least for now, entirely their own.</p><p>Belcorra first spotted Jafaki and several other seugathis slithering through the Darklands while she was building the Abomination Vaults. They expressed an eagerness to serve her and advance their own experiments. Belcorra knew the seugathis could improve her forces, as well as expand. She tasked them with building her a perfect soldier, then making armies of them to conquer Absalom. Knowing that perfection was a high price to ask, Belcorra funneled all the resources she could to the seugathis. The seugathis pursued not one research path but many, including fleshwarping, monster breeding, and even dabbling in magical constructs. Belcorra didn’t mind this broad experimentation, as nearly all of it provided her with useful monsters for her growing army. She passed along the seugathis’ innovations to other alchemists and mages who could duplicate the work. </p><p>When the Roseguard defeated Belcorra, the seugathis nevertheless continued pursuing their objective. Their initial obstacle was a bone devil named Tarkannah. Tarkannah deemed that ongoing duty to Belcorra—to whom the bone devil remained loyal even after her death—meant taking a firmer hand in overseeing the seugathis. Tarkannah tried to constrain and direct the seugathis’ sprawling research. Rather than comply with these unwelcome demands, the seugathis rebelled; Jafaki ambushed and killed Tarkannah and seized control of the laboratories. </p><p>This assault started a brief war between the devils and the seugathis. For months the two sides fought, but Urevian soon discovered the seugathis weren’t interested in expanding their holdings, and the two sides settled in an uneasy truce on their respective levels of the vaults. These front lines aren’t absolute; Urevian is happy to permit potential “raw materials” to pass through the prison, as the seugathis’ cast-off creatures often find their way into the devil’s gradually increasing forces. </p><p>Jafaki has little concern for the army growing beneath the laboratories. The seugathis don’t bother with the imp and zebub spies that pass through the laboratories, but Jafaki and their colleagues can make marching through with a large army costly or even impossible. Jafaki plans to permit free passage only in exchange for additional concessions to bolster their ongoing experiments, even though Urevian is certain to balk at the cost. </p><p>Jafaki’s research has seemed to drift over the years through various abhorrent sciences: fleshwarping, reanimation of the dead, selective breeding, or even golem creation. Yet they remain as focused on their goal of creating the perfect soldier as they were when they spoke to Belcorra all those years ago.</p><p>That word has driven Jafaki for centuries. Good soldiers?

Fortunately, Belcorra’s death had thrown the dungeon into chaos and he wasn’t discovered. When Otari woke some time later, no longer on the edge of death from his ordeal, he crept out of the room and made his way west through area <b>B31</b> and eventually to <b>B20</b>, only to be confronted by an angry and oversized chuul.

Much of the lumberyard’s income comes from the town’s two larger lumber families, who pay to have their lumber processed here.

His initial attitude to the heroes is indifferent, but if they can improve this attitude (most likely with a successful DC 21 Diplomacy check to Make an Impression, but you might decide that other checks—such as a Deception check to Impersonate or to Lie—also appease Korlok), Korlok admits his frustration. He knows Belcorra is dead, but without access to his contract, he can’t study it for a loophole. He suggests a trade—he’ll let the heroes go just this once, but the next time they return he will arrest them if they don’t present him with his contract. He isn’t sure where the paper is stored, but suspects it’s hidden somewhere in the library.</p><p>If the heroes present the contract, Korlok studies it and discovers that his service was meant to end if 99 weeks and 99 days passed without a new order from Belcorra. Before he vanishes back to Hell, the thankful devil explains that he knows of other devils in the Abomination Vaults: a zebub janitor on the level above and a contract devil named Urevian on a lower level (who has several other devils in his command). Korlok has nothing but scorn for the zebub, but he says that Urevian is shrewd but well-known for keeping his word.

Ysondkhelir insisted that Urevian’s zebubs keep scouting the surface and report back to him, which has allowed the denizen to make the exceptionally detailed map found here.</p><p>Instead of planning troop movements, Ysondkhelir seeks powerful latent psychics whom he can torment and, by means of eldritch invocations, send physically into the Dimension of Dreams so that other denizens of Leng can make use of them. He has had little success in the last five centuries—not only is true psychic potential very rare, but Ysondkhelir is as likely to drive his victims to insanity as to successfully send them to his extraplanar compatriots. He had most recently manipulated the addled skulk Jedzeli (area <b>C12</b>).
